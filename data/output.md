# Safety
#### Driving the Machine
Before moving away, always check immediate vicinity of the machine
(example for children). Ensure adequate visibility. Use the horn as
a warning immediately before moving away.
Always adapt ground speed to the road or field conditions. Avoid
making sharp turns when driving up or down slopes or when driving
across a slope. Be especially careful when turning on slopes with
a full grain tank.
Follow instructions in header Operator's Manual when attaching
or detaching the header.
When making turns, always take into consideration the width
of the attachment and the fact that the rear end of the machine swings
out. Attachments and ground conditions affect the driving characteristics
of the combine.
Reduce ground speed when driving on slopes or over uneven ground
and before making sharp turns. Before descending a steep hill, shift
to a lower gear.
Avoid holes, ditches, and obstructions which may cause the combine
to tip, particularly on hillsides.

# Safety
#### Operator Ability

being operated in an unsafe manner.
Children should never be allowed on the machine or in the combine
cab when the engine is running.
The instructional seat should only be used for instruction or
short periods of machine observation, and not for the accommodation
of children.

# Safety
#### Ballasting for Safe Ground Contact
Operating, steering and braking performance of combine can be
considerably affected by heavy front end attachments which alter the
center of gravity of the combine.
To maintain the necessary ground contact, ballast the combine
at the rear end as necessary.
Observe the maximum permissible axle loads and total weights.

# Safety
#### Avoid Electrical Power Lines
Put the grain tank unloading auger in transport position and
lower the grain tank access handrail before driving on public roads.
Secure radio aerial in its transport position before driving
on public roads, it may come into contact with low-hanging electrical
cables. This would result in the operator suffering a severe electrical
shock.

# Safety
#### Parking and Leaving the Machine

can, keep the cap on the container, and store in a cool, protected
location.
Do not incinerate or puncture a starting fluid container.
Do not use starting fluid on an engine equipped with glow plugs
or an air intake heater.

# Safety
#### In Case of Fire
Avoid personal injury.
Stop machine immediately at the first sign of fire. Fire may
be identified by the smell of smoke or sight of flames. Because fire
grows and spreads rapidly, get off the machine immediately and move
safely away from the fire. Do not return to the machine! The number
one priority is safety.
Call the fire department. A portable fire extinguisher can put
out a small fire or contain it until the fire department arrives;
but portable extinguishers have limitations. Always put the safety
of the operator and bystanders first. If attempting to extinguish
a fire, keep your back to the wind with an unobstructed escape path
so you can move away quickly if the fire cannot be extinguished.
Read the fire extinguisher instructions and become familiar
with their location, parts, and operation before a fire starts. Local
fire departments or fire equipment distributors may offer fire extinguisher
training and recommendations.
If your extinguisher does not have instructions, follow these
general guidelines:
Pull the pin. Hold the
extinguisher with the nozzle pointing away from you, and release the
locking mechanism.
Aim low. Point the extinguisher
at the base of the fire.
Squeeze the lever slowly
and evenly.
Sweep the nozzle from
side-to-side.

# Safety
#### Avoid Static Electricity Risk When Refueling
The removal of sulfur and other compounds in Ultra-Low Sulfur
Diesel (ULSD) fuel decreases its conductivity and increases its ability
to store a static charge.
Refineries may have treated the fuel with a static dissipating
additive. However, there are many factors that can reduce the effectiveness
of the additive over time.
Static charges can build up in ULSD fuel while it is flowing
through fuel delivery systems. Static electricity discharge when combustible
vapors are present could result in a fire or explosion.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that the entire system
used to refuel your machine (fuel supply tank, transfer pump, transfer
hose, nozzle, and others) is properly grounded and bonded. Consult
with your fuel or fuel system supplier to ensure that the delivery
system is in compliance with fueling standards for proper grounding
and bonding practices.

# Operating the Engine
#### Clean Exhaust Filter Safely
During exhaust filter cleaning operations, the engine may run
at elevated idle and hot temperatures for an extended period of time.
Exhaust gases and exhaust filter components reach temperatures hot
enough to burn people, or ignite or melt common materials.
Keep machine away from people, animals, or structures which
may be susceptible to harm or damage from hot exhaust gases or components.
Avoid potential fire or explosion hazards from flammable materials
and vapors near the exhaust. Keep exhaust outlet away from people
and anything that can melt, burn, or explode.
Closely monitor machine and surrounding area for smoldering
debris during and after exhaust filter cleaning.
Adding fuel while an engine is running can create a fire or
explosion hazard. Always stop engine before refueling machine and
clean up any spilled fuel.
Always make sure that engine is stopped while hauling machine
on a truck or trailer.
Contact with exhaust components while still hot can result in
serious personal injury.
Avoid contact with these components until cooled to safe temperatures.
If service procedure requires engine to be running:
Only engage power-driven parts required by service procedure
Ensure that other people are clear of operator station
and machine
Keep hands, feet, and clothing away from power-driven parts.
Always disable movement (neutral), set the parking brake or
mechanism and disconnect power to attachments or tools before leaving
the operator’s station.
Shut off engine and remove key (if equipped) before leaving
the machine unattended.

# Operating the Engine
#### Avoid Hot Exhaust
Servicing machine or attachments with engine running can result
in serious personal injury. Avoid exposure and skin contact with hot
exhaust gases and components.
Exhaust parts and streams become very hot during operation.
Exhaust gases and components reach temperatures hot enough to burn
people, ignite, or melt common materials.

# Operating the Engine
#### Aftertreatment Indicators Overview
The operator will be informed by the operator warning
system when the emission control system does not function correctly
and/or an engine malfunction is detected by the engine control unit.
Ignoring the operator warning signals will lead to an emission related
derate, resulting in an effective disablement of non-road mobile machinery
operation.
It is essential to take prompt action to rectify any incorrect
operation, use or maintenance of the emissions control system in accordance
with the rectification measures indicated by the warnings referenced
below.
The Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) indicator illuminates when the
DEF is low. Fill DEF tank.
When the DEF indicator is combined with the warning indicator
or engine stop indicator engine performance is reduced by the Engine
Control Unit (ECU) because the DEF is below a measurable level. Fill
DEF tank.
When engine emissions temperature indicator illuminates exhaust
gas temperature is high, elevated idle is active, or exhaust filter
cleaning is in process. The machine can be operated as normal unless
the operator determines the machine is not in a safe location for
high exhaust temperatures and disables auto cleaning.
When engine emissions temperature indicator is combined with
the warning indicator or engine stop indicator engine performance
is reduced by the ECU because the exhaust gas temperature is higher
than expected. Follow Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) procedure or see
your authorized servicing dealer.
When the exhaust filter indicator illuminates the exhaust filter
cleaning is in process, aftertreatment system has a fault, or the
exhaust filter is in need of cleaning and the operator has disabled
auto exhaust filter cleaning. If conditions are safe, the operator
should enable the auto exhaust filter clean setting or perform manual
service regeneration or follow DTC procedure.
When the exhaust filter indicator is combined with the warning
indicator engine performance is reduced by the ECU because there is
an aftertreatment system fault or the soot level of the exhaust filter
is moderately high. If conditions are safe, the operator should enable
the auto exhaust filter clean function. If conditions are not safe,
the operator should move the machine to a safe location and engage
the auto exhaust filter cleaning mode. Perform manual service regeneration
or follow DTC procedure.
When the exhaust filter indicator is combined with the engine
stop indicator engine performance is further reduced by the ECU because
there is an aftertreatment system fault or the soot level of the exhaust
filter is extremely high. If this combination is present, see your
authorized servicing dealer.
The auto cleaning disabled indicator illuminates when the operator
has engaged the request to disable the auto exhaust filter cleaning
function. This icon remains illuminated until the operator re-engages
automatic exhaust filter cleaning from the diagnostic gauge. Disabling
auto mode is not recommended for any situation unless it is safety-related
or if the fuel tank lacks the required fuel to complete the cleaning
process.
The engine emissions system malfunction indicator illuminates
when engine emissions are outside of normal operating range or engine
emissions system fault. Follow DTC procedure or see your authorized
servicing dealer.
When the engine emissions system malfunction indicator is combined
with the warning indicator engine performance is reduced by the ECU
because the engine emissions are outside of normal operating range
or engine emissions system fault. Follow DTC procedure or see your
authorized servicing dealer.

# Operating the Engine
#### Required Machine Stop Warning
In some situations, machine engine power may be reduced
as described. On notification, immediately place the machine in a
safe state and or move it to a safe location. A mandated machine stop
can only be removed by a service technician.

# Operating the Engine
#### Starting the Engine
Engine exhaust
fumes can cause sickness or death. If it is necessary to run an engine
in an enclosed area, remove exhaust fumes from area with an exhaust
pipe extension.
If you do not have an exhaust pipe extension,
open doors and get outside air into area.
Move multi-function lever (A) to neutral position.
Verify that header engage
switch (B) and separator engage switch (C) are OFF.
To avoid the possibility of personal
injury or death, start engine ONLY from the operator’s seat. Do not
start engine by shorting across starter terminals. Machine starts
in gear if bypassed.
To prevent starter damage, do not operate starter
for more than 30 seconds at a time. If engine does not start, wait
at least 2 minutes before trying again.
If temperature is below 4°C (40°F), it may be necessary
to use cold weather starting aid. See Cold Weather Starting Aid in
Operating the Engine section in the Operator’s Manual.
When the key switch is turned to START, a delay of a couple of seconds
will occur. This allows control units to power up, relays to close,
and starter solenoid to energize.

# Operating the Engine
#### Stopping the Engine
Move multi-function lever
(A) to neutral position.
Press slow speed engine
switch (B).
Shut OFF header engage
switch (C) and separator engage switch (D).
Cooling of turbocharger and some engine parts is
provided by engine oil. Stopping a hot engine might cause damage to
these parts.
Before stopping an engine that was operating at working
load, idle engine 2—3 minutes to allow turbocharger to cool.
Set park brake and remove key before leaving machine.
Turn the key switch to the OFF position.
Final Tier 4/Stage V: Do not disconnect battery for
at least 90 seconds after machine is shut OFF. Selective Catalyst
Reduction (SCR) system automatically purges lines of Diesel Exhaust
Fluid (DEF) during this time, immediately after machine is shut OFF.
If adequate time is not allowed for lines to be purged, any fluid
remaining in lines can crystallize and plug lines. In freezing weather,
fluid freezes and possibly burst lines.

# Operating the Engine
#### Handle Starting Fluid Safely
If starting fluid is not used for several days, remove can.
Check fluid and valve operation by reinstalling and depressing spray
nozzle. If no fluid is emitted, use a new can.
To prevent accidental discharge when storing the pressurized
can, keep cap on container. Store in a cool, protected location.
Do not incinerate or puncture a starting fluid container.

# Operating the Engine
#### Cold Weather Starting Aid (If Equipped)
The starting aid is software controlled.
Turn the key switch to start the engine and if the
software determines that starting aid is needed, it injects starting
aid.
When the engine starts,
release the key switch.
To ensure proper lubrication, operate engine at slow
speed with no load for 1—2 minutes. Extend this period to 2—4 minutes
when operating at temperatures below freezing.

# Operating the Engine
#### Coolant Heater
Before connecting the heater to the
power source, be sure that element is immersed in coolant. NEVER energize
the heater in the air. Doing so can cause the element sheath to burst,
causing personal injury.
Coolant heater (A) mounts in the freeze plug opening (front
side or rear side of engine). By warming the engine coolant, the heater
reduces oil drag, eases starting, and shortens warm-up time.

a heavier header down force setting. Header down force on the ground
increases with heavier header down force settings. Accelerated component
wear can occur in heavier header down force settings.
Ground conditions are soft, the header is pushing material,
or dampening of the header's response to abrupt terrain features is
desired. Select a lighter header down force setting. Header down force
on the ground decreases with lighter header down force settings. Reduced
terrain-following response can occur in lighter header down force
settings.
Ground conditions are abrasive (hard, dry, sandy, or rocky)
and increased component life is desired. Select a lighter header down
force setting.

# Header Application
#### Gauge Wheels
Gauge Wheels allows you to raise or lower the gauge wheels on
the hinged draper.
Avoid over-lowering the feeder house. Even with the
gauge wheels lowered, the independent attachment frame and feeder
house can continue to lower. Further lowering of the feeder house
drives the attachment frame and center draper pan into the ground
causing draper pan damage.
Cut the crop closer to the ground; raise the gauge wheels.
Cut the crop higher off the ground; lower the gauge wheels.
This method is useful when stubble is higher than desired
when cresting terraces or hills. These types of terrain features may
require you to manually adjust the cutterbar position by raising and
lowering the gauge wheels to maintain a consistent cut height.
Ensure that Height Sensing
mode is active.
Release the header raise/lower
switch. The gauge wheels and feeder house will return to their original
positions and the original cut height will be restored.

#### Performance Target
Performance Target allows you to adjust the number of bars on
the Corner Post Display VisionTrak for the shoe loss indicator, separator
loss indicator, and total loss indicator to a level representative
of the grain loss exiting the machine.
Changing crop type.
Harvesting conditions vary (wet crop versus dry crop,
high moisture versus low moisture, variety A versus variety B, or
large swings in seed size or yield).
It is not necessary to set a new target if you are using
a recent performance target for this crop type and harvesting conditions.
Larger seed sizes, such as corn or soybeans, generally
have a lower numerical calibration value than smaller seed sizes,
such as wheat or canola.
Selecting a lower calibration value registers more bars
on the display  for the same acceptable grain loss.
Operate the machine at the desired performance and select
Set to Current; this stores operating characteristics to memory and
centers the total loss indicator.
Clicking Set Performance Target in Combine Advisor™ also
performs an Automatic Target for Grain Loss.
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 99
Increment: 1
The Automatic setting is recommended. The Manual setting
should only be used if the Automatic setting does not give the desired
results.
If the total loss indicator bar graph is above or below the green
area and losses are acceptable, the grain loss monitor is either incorrectly
adjusted or there is a higher flow of material through the machine
since the grain loss monitor was last calibrated. Higher flow of material
can be caused by increased ground speed or higher crop yields.
When the machine encounters a “slug”, the middle bar graph will
fluctuate upward (15 to 20 seconds) and then return to the previous
reading. Ignore these fluctuations when this occurs.

# Engine Application
#### Exhaust Filter System Overview
Your machine is equipped with an emission-compliant engine,
which cleans and filters the exhaust. Under normal machine operation
and with the system in AUTO mode, the system requires minimal operator
interaction.
To avoid the unnecessary buildup of diesel particulates or soot
in the exhaust filter system:
Avoid unnecessary idling.
Use proper engine oil.
Use only ultra low sulfur fuel.
For more information, refer to Fuels and Lubricants section
in the machine Operator's Manual.
When AUTO or PARKED cleaning is enabled, the exhaust
temperature can be high under no load or light load conditions at
certain times during the exhaust filter cleaning cycle.
Servicing machine or attachments during the exhaust filter cleaning
can result in serious personal injury. Avoid exposure and skin contact
with hot exhaust gases and components.
During auto or
manual/stationary exhaust filter cleaning operations, the engine runs
at elevated temperatures for up to 45 minutes. To avoid injury or
fire, verify exhaust filter, components, and outlet are free of debris.
During entire cleaning process, keep exhaust outlet away from people,
buildings, and anything that can melt, burn, or explode.

#### Header Suspension Service Mode
This procedure can be used to release hydraulic pressure from
the hinged draper suspension systems. Releasing hydraulic load makes
service and maintenance possible and can be controlled for either
wing of the header.
There is stored hydraulic energy on the header even
when the header is not running and not attached to a combine. Service
of the suspension system requires discharging of the system via the
header suspension service mode. Follow the instructions to ensure
that the system is completely discharged prior to service.
Hydraulic suspension service mode drains hydraulic
oil from the header into the machine's hydraulic reservoir. The hydraulic
reservoir on S-Series machines does not have enough capacity to hold
the oil stored in both sides of the header along with the oil already
present in the hydraulic reservoir. Service one side of the header
at a time.
Service or maintenance is required on front end equipment
suspension systems.

# Separator
#### General-Purpose Chaffer 30 mm (1-3/16 in)
General-purpose chaffer is suitable for corn, soybeans, sorghum,
small grains, oil seed crops, grass seed, and many specialty crops.
It is recommended for dry conditions and is resistant to “stabbing”
of corn tassels and soybean, sunflower, and sorghum stems.

# Separator
#### Deep-Tooth Chaffer 41 mm (1-5/8 in)
Not

Deep-tooth chaffer and deep-tooth sieve provide additional grain
separation capacity in high moisture and high yield corn and high-capacity
and clean grain sample in corn and soybeans.

# Separator
#### Flat-Tooth Comb Chaffer 30 mm (1-3/16 in)
The
flat-tooth comb chaffer requires a 2—3 mm wider chaffer clearance
opening and 50 rpm higher fan speed compared to the general-purpose
chaffer.
The flat-tooth comb chaffer improves tailings volume and grain
tank sample, especially in challenging conditions (weedy conditions
and heavily bearded crops), such as canola, oil seed (rape), and lentils.
The curled chaffer finger reduces the amount of longer sticks passing
through the chaffer.

After welding, reverse
Steps 1—5.

# Service—Electrical System
#### Keep Electronic Control Unit Connectors Clean
Do not open control unit and do not clean with a
high-pressure spray. Moisture, dirt, and other contaminants may cause
permanent damage.
Keep terminals clean and free of foreign debris. Moisture,
dirt, and other contaminants may cause the terminals to erode over
time and not make a good electrical connection.
If a connector is not
in use, put on the proper dust cap or an appropriate seal to protect
it from foreign debris and moisture.
Control units are not
repairable.
Since control units are
the components LEAST likely to fail, isolate failure before replacing
by completing a diagnostic procedure. (See your John Deere dealer.)
The wiring harness terminals
and connectors for electronic control units are repairable.

# Service—Electrical System
#### Observe Electrical Precautions
Keep all sparks
and flames away from batteries as gas given off by electrolyte is
explosive. To avoid sparks, connect ground cable last and disconnect
it first. To avoid shocks and burns, turn battery disconnect switch
OFF before servicing any part of the electrical system or when removing
batteries.

# Service—Electrical System
#### Basic Electrical Component Handling / Precautions for Vehicles
Equipped with Computer Controlled Systems
Never disconnect the batteries while the key switch is
on and the engine is running.
Why: This can cause electrical
voltage spikes that can damage electronic components.
Do not connect jumper cables while the key switch is on.
Why: This can cause electrical voltage spikes that can damage
electronic components.
Disconnect batteries prior to recharging (if possible)
Why: Electrical loads in the machine can slow the recharging
process. Battery chargers can cause electrical voltage spikes that
can damage electronic components.
Never jump start the machine with a voltage higher than
the machine is designed to operate on
Why: This can damage
electronic components
Do not connect or disconnect electrical connectors while
the key switch is on or the machine is running.
Why:
This can cause computer system errors from interrupting a computer
program while it is running and electrical voltage spikes that are
produced can damage electronic components.
Do not apply power or ground to any component as a test
unless specifically instructed to do so.
Why: Connecting
the wrong voltage to the wrong point of an electronic system can cause
electronic component failures.
When welding on the machine, make sure to connect ground
lead to the parts being welded. For maximum protection disconnect
all electronic controllers before welding.
Why: The high
currents associated with welding can damage wiring harnesses that
are involved in the ground path. Welding can also cause electrical
voltage spikes that can damage electronic components.

# Service—Electrical System
#### Handling Batteries Safely
Battery gas can explode. Keep sparks and flames away from batteries.
Use a flashlight to check battery electrolyte level.
Never check battery charge by placing a metal object across
the posts. Use a voltmeter or hydrometer.
Always remove grounded (-) battery clamp first and replace grounded
clamp last.
Sulfuric acid in battery electrolyte is poisonous and strong
enough to burn skin, eat holes in clothing, and cause blindness if
splashed into eyes.
Filling batteries in a well-ventilated area
Wearing eye protection and rubber gloves
Avoiding use of air pressure to clean batteries
Avoiding breathing fumes when electrolyte is added
Avoiding spilling or dripping electrolyte
Using correct battery booster or charger procedure.
Flush skin with water.
Apply baking soda or lime to help neutralize the acid.
Flush eyes with water for 15—30 minutes. Get medical attention
immediately.
Do not induce vomiting.
Drink large amounts of water or milk, but do not exceed
2 L (2 qt.).
Get medical attention immediately.

# Service—Electrical System
#### Batteries—Safe Installation
Avoid serious injury
or death from explosions. High levels of hydrogen gas can accumulate
if the battery box is not vented properly. Always reinstall the vent
tubes (A) after performing service or maintenance on the batteries
or the battery box. Verify that the ventilation hoses are not bent
or kinked.
Replacement batteries must have a ventilation
fitting suited for ventilation hose attachment. See your John Deere
dealer for replacement batteries equipped with ventilation fittings.
If ventilation tubes are not attached to the battery, then the
battery lid must remain off whenever the machine engine is running
or whenever the batteries are being charged with an external charger.

# Service—Electrical System
#### Battery Cables—Connecting
BATTERIES ARE NEGATIVE GROUNDED ONLY. Always connect
the battery ground strap to the negative (-) posts of the battery.
Connect the starter cable to the positive (+) post of the battery.
Reversed polarity in the battery or alternator connections results
in permanent damage to the electrical system. Connect the ground strap
to the negative (-) terminal last.
Batteries must have same terminal locations.
Turn off all of the switches and accessories. Clean
the battery posts and the terminals.
QUICKLY TAP the ground
strap to the negative post. Arcing must not occur. If arcing occurs,
DO NOT MAKE CONNECTION. Check to see if the battery position is reversed.
If arcing still occurs,
check again that all of the switches and accessories are off. Then,
check for shorts, broken wires, and loose or corroded connections.
Connect the negative
(-) battery ground straps.

# Service—Electrical System
#### Batteries—Charging
Keep the battery fully charged, especially during cold weather.
Failure to keep the battery fully charged, above 12.50 V, may result
in reduced battery life.
Never charge a frozen battery. Thaw at room temperature
before connecting to the battery charger. Only charge the batteries
in a well ventilated area. Disconnect both cables from the battery
terminals when charging the batteries in combine.
If the batteries are not fully charged, the electrolyte
may freeze.
Determine which battery needs to be charged.
Disconnect both of the
battery cables and connect the charger positive cable to the "+"
terminal and the charger negative cable to the "-" terminal.
Follow instructions provided
with the charger. Always charge the batteries with a 12-volt charger.

# Service—Electrical System
#### Batteries—Checking Specific Gravity
Battery gas can
explode. Keep sparks and flames away from batteries. Use a flashlight
to check battery electrolyte level.
Never check the battery
charge by placing a metal object across the posts. Use a voltmeter
or hydrometer.
Check specific gravity of the electrolyte in each
cell with a battery hydrometer to determine battery condition. Charge
battery if reading is below 1.225. Replace battery if difference between
cells is more than 0.050.
Always correct specific
gravity reading for electrolyte temperature variation. Add 0.004 for
every 10°F above 80°F. (Add 0.007 for every 10°C above 27°C.) Subtract
at the same rate if the electrolyte temperature is below 80°F (27°C).
Corrected specific gravity of a fully charged battery is 1.265—1.280.

#### Adjust Machine Light Angles (Detailed Adjustment)
Move machine away from any obstructions using dimensions
(A and B).
A traffic cone, for example, can be used as an object
for a reference point.
Use dimension (C) to place an object (D) directly
in front of the machine as a reference point.
Use the detailed information
shown to adjust the following lights around the machine:
Cab Headlights (low-beam)
Cab Headlights (high-beam)
Cab Worklights
Row Finder Lights
Stubble Lights
360° Side Lights (optional)
Rear Discharge Lights
Turn ON the cab headlights (low-beam) (A and C).
If you have difficulty using the Lights Application, unplug
the lights and plug them in as needed.
Use the Lights Application to turn OFF all the lights
except for the left-hand cab headlight (low-beam).
The light pattern should stop just before the object (B)
placed in front of the machine.
Adjust the left-hand cab headlight (low-beam) to specification.
See information later in this section on adjusting the cab headlights.

#### Service Tires Safely
Explosive separation of a tire and rim parts can cause
serious injury or death.
Do not attempt to mount a tire
unless you have the proper equipment and experience to perform the
job.
Always maintain the correct tire pressure. Do not inflate the
tires above the recommended pressure.
Never weld or heat a wheel and tire assembly. The heat can cause
an increase in air pressure resulting in a tire explosion. Welding
can structurally weaken or deform the wheel.
When inflating tires, use a clip-on chuck and extension hose
long enough to allow you to stand to one side and NOT in front of
or over the tire assembly. Use a safety cage if available.
Check wheels for low pressure, cuts, bubbles, damaged rims or
missing lug bolts and nuts.

#### Care and Service of Tires
Installing tires that do not meet original equipment
tire specifications may cause machine malfunction. Consult your dealer
or tire supplier for guidance.
Use of substandard tires
or larger than recommended tires will void warranty and may decrease
stability, affect steering, result in premature tire failure, or cause
other durability or safety issues.
Check tires daily for damage or noticeably low pressure.
At least every 100 hours of operation, check tire pressure.
If tires contain liquid ballast, use a special air-water gauge and
measure with valve stem at bottom.
A small puncture in a tubeless tire can be temporarily repaired
without dismounting the tire, thus avoiding down time during a busy
season.
Protect tires from exposure to sunlight, petroleum products,
and chemicals.
Drive carefully. Try to avoid rocks and sharp objects.
A permanent repair should be made as soon as possible
to prevent further tire damage.
Tire information and specifications are based on the latest
information available at the time of publication. The right is reserved
to make changes at any time without notice. See the online Combine
Ag Sales Manual or your John Deere dealer for further information
on Tire Pressure Charts.
Tire pressures listed in charts
may differ from the tire pressures shown on the side of the tires.
Header compatibility and specified inflation pressures are based
on front axle load of a coarse grain configuration.
Load
varies based on configuration. This may not reflect the worst case
scenario. Consult your local tire dealer if in doubt.
Not all tires are available on all machines or at all manufacturing
facilities.
Onboard Air Compressor (if equipped) - not
recommended to inflate tires on the machine or run air tools.

# Ground Drive and Rear Axle
#### Basic Tire Information
The diagonal tire (bias) is identified by conventional nomenclature.
The radial tire can be identified by conventional nomenclature
or international system.
The high flotation tires are identified by a mixed nomenclature.

# Ground Drive and Rear Axle
#### Tire Tread Types
There are three types of tread and these are the most used on
agricultural application.

# Ground Drive and Rear Axle
#### Front Tire Pressure
All road transportation MUST be done at pressure
shown in No Head/Transport column. Improper pressure during transport
may decrease vehicle stability. Proper pressure results in better
fuel economy and longer tire life.

#### Front and Rear Tire Information
If tires or final drives are changed from what was originally
shipped from the factory, it is necessary to recalibrate the system.
When changing drive wheels, tire radius may also
change. POD control unit MUST be set to the new tire radius. See your
John Deere dealer for further information on changing the tire codes.
Failure to calibrate system results in inaccurate Harvest Monitor
Yields.

#### Front Drive Wheel Offset
Use only John Deere supplied wheels, tires, and spacers.
Use of non-John Deere components not meeting specification voids the
warranty.
Do not use clamp-on style duals. They do not
meet John Deere specification.
Wheel offset distance severely affects life of final drive parts.
When installing drive wheels, ensure that offset dimension (A) measured
from spindle surface (B) to centerline (C) is within specification.

After the first hour of operation and again after every 10 hours
of operation, torque wheel bolts to specification until 50 hours of
operation is completed. Torque wheel bolts every 100 hours thereafter.
Refer to decal on the tire for proper torque sequence.

# Ground Drive and Rear Axle
#### Using Liquid Weight
Cover rim completely with solution to avoid corrosion,
but NEVER fill any tire more than 90% full. More solution would leave
too little air space to absorb shocks. Damage to tire could occur.
A solution of water and calcium chloride provides a safe and
economical ballast. Used properly, it will not damage tires, tubes,
or rims.
Use calcium chloride to prevent water from freezing. A mixture
of 1.6 kg (3-1/2 lb) of calcium chloride per 3.8 L (1 gal) will not
freeze solid above -45°C (-50°F).
Use of alcohol as liquid ballast is not recommended. Calcium
chloride solution is heavier and more economical.
Fill tubeless tires at least to valve level (minimum 75% full).
Less solution would expose part of rim, possibly causing corrosion.
Tube-type tires may be filled to any level below 90%.

# Ground Drive and Rear Axle
#### Ballast Requirements
Ballast requirements vary based on configuration.
Ballast requirements are based off standard Corn Pricing configuration,
133 L (35 gal) fuel in tank, and full grain tank. This may not reflect
all scenarios.
Tires requiring fluid must be filled to
75%.

# Harvesting Hints
#### Operation at Low Temperatures
When operating in cold temperatures, verify that
proper grade diesel fuel is being used. Warmer grade diesel fuel will
gel in fuel lines, fuel filters, and fuel tank. Fuel system requires
servicing if diesel fuel gels. See Fuels and Lubricants section for
further information.
Combine functions can degrade in low temperatures where snow
and ice are present. Special care MUST be taken to ensure that minimal
snow is ingested in combine. If snow is ingested, areas such as chaffer,
cleaning fan, separator concaves, and separator grates can become
obstructed. Operation with these areas obstructed could cause machine
damage and significant repairs or result in functional performance
degradation. Consult your John Deere dealer prior to operating in
cold temperatures.

# Harvesting Hints
#### Harvesting Tips
Adjust machine to crop being harvested and to field conditions.
Select a ground speed that does not overload machine. Engine
must be at full rpm to keep separator at full speed. Select a ground
speed for slower travel, but do not slow engine speed.
If the concave is set too close for the harvested crop, straw
will be excessively ground up requiring more horsepower to thresh
the crop.
If the concave is set too wide for the harvested crop, it will
not be completely threshed.
After threshing clearance is adjusted properly, adjust separator
speed to achieve maximum threshing with the least amount of crop damage.
If crop damage does occur, reduce feed accelerator speed. Threshing
clearance in these crops has very little effect on seed damage.
Crops such as edible beans and peas are easily cracked and can
require the use of a slower feed accelerator drive. When harvesting
edible beans and peas keep machine full to provide enough material
to cushion the crop against cracking.
For potential improvements in straw quality consider that the
following can help improve straw quality depending on conditions:
Slowing feeder house chain speed
Slowing feed accelerator speed
Slowing rotor speed
Opening concave
Reducing threshing elements
Installing round bar concaves
For improved performance in sidehill conditions, consider trying
the following:
Adjust the position of the angled dividers on the front
step pan to improve shoe distribution.
Install tall chaffer dividers (available from your John
Deere dealer).
Install separator grate covers (if equipped) to improve
the chaff and grain distribution.
Each of these actions can improve the chaff and grain distribution
to the cleaning shoe, resulting in improved performance in sidehill
conditions.
When using a cutting platform, cut crop as high as possible
without loss of low heads. Adjust reel position and speed for even
feeding. Keep cutterbar in register and guards in alignment for clean
cutting.
When harvesting corn, keep corn head only as low as necessary
for ears. Keep it centered in the rows to prevent ear loss.
When using a belt pickup, keep windrow centered so material
is fed evenly into the feeder house. Grain heads must be lying in
one direction. Operate machine so heads are picked up first.
When harvesting soybeans with a row-crop head, keep header as
low as possible. When harvesting crops such as milo or sunflowers,
operate header just low enough to cut the heads from the stalks.
Adjust chaffer openings to pass grain or seed to the lower sieve
in the first two-thirds of the chaffer without admitting too much
coarse material.
Use as much air as possible without blowing over clean grain
and seed. Heavy crops require more air than light seed crops.

# Harvesting Hints
#### Change Tire Radius Code
If tires or final drives are changed from what was originally
shipped from the factory, it is necessary to recalibrate the system.
When changing drive wheels, tire radius may also
change. POD control unit MUST be set to the new tire radius. See your
John Deere dealer for further information on changing the tire codes.
Failure to calibrate system results in inaccurate

# Harvesting Hints
#### Single Point Yield Calibration Or Multi-Point Yield Calibration
The best way to keep the flow rate constant
is to monitor the
Single point yield calibration is performed when one or up to
three calibration loads are collected.
This type of calibration is suggested when the harvested field
has a fairly consistent yield and machine is operated at a constant
ground speed with little flow variation.
To collect a calibration load, harvest approximately 2722 kg
(6000 lb) at the maximum harvest speed.
Running one or two additional loads is not required, but it
may allow the system to average the overall error.
Multi-point yield calibration is used when the harvested field
is expected to have varying yields or machine is operated at varying
speeds with varying grain flows.
This type of calibration collects each calibration load at each
expected flow condition.
For each calibration load, harvest approximately 2722 kg (6000
lb).
Run at least

#### Power Shutdown Procedure
A power shutdown is used to determine the machine’s performance
in the threshing and separating areas by taking a "snapshot"
of the material in the separator. This is valuable in determining
where the losses behind the machine are generated and what adjustments
can be made to correct the condition.
Verify that crop
condition and material intake is similar for each shutdown.
Locate engine speed indicator on corner post display
and threshing speed readout on armrest display.
Lock brake pedals together.
Operate machine at optimized
throughput levels in the desired crop.
Move steering wheel forward
for free motion (both hands needed).
Press low idle engine
speed switch on armrest.
The machine is designed to have a slower draw down of
the engine rpm and more of a run-on for separator components.
Lightly depress brake pedals (machine attempts to
repower and downshifts changing the machine dynamics if brakes are
fully depressed).
Quickly move the multi-function
lever to neutral position.
Allow engine to cool
for a minute.
Inspect for excessive
grain damage, kernels left on the cobs, uneven distribution of material
on the return pan and cleaning shoe, and free grain loss before making
any adjustments.
Decide what adjustments
are needed. Open threshing clearance and engage separator (avoids
undue stress to cylinder drive area during cleanout).
Adjust machine to desired
settings and continue harvesting.
Repeat this procedure
and verify grain quality and losses behind machine.
Once acceptable loss
levels are attained, calibrate

# Fire Prevention
#### Recommended Fire Preventions
The machine must be inspected periodically throughout the harvest
day. Buildup of crop material and other debris must be removed to
ensure proper machine function and to reduce the risk of fire.
Regular and thorough cleaning of machine combined with other
routine maintenance procedures listed in the Operator’s Manual greatly
reduces the risk of fire, chance of costly downtime, and improve machine
performance.
Always follow all safety procedures posted on the machine and
in the Operator’s Manual. Before carrying out any inspection or cleaning,
always shut OFF engine, set park brake, and remove key.
Your machine is equipped with a general-purpose powder fire
extinguisher and a pressurized liquid fire extinguisher. Extinguishers
must be checked daily when entering or exiting the cab and when working
around machine to ensure that they are in working condition. Fire
extinguishers must be replaced or professionally serviced after any
usage.
For further information, refer to Machine Cleanout section.

# Fire Prevention
#### Fire Extinguisher Operation
Your machine is equipped with a general-purpose powder fire
extinguisher and a pressurized liquid fire extinguisher. Extinguishers
must be checked daily when entering or exiting the cab and when working
around the machine to ensure that they are in working condition. Fire
extinguishers must be replaced or professionally serviced after any
usage.
Read label on extinguishers and become familiar with
instructions and restrictions to use them.
General-Purpose Powder Fire Extinguisher:
Use the extinguisher for grease, oil, electrical, and
chemical fires.
Pressurized Liquid Fire Extinguisher:
Use the extinguisher on crop material buildup or crop
debris fires.
The diagram shows the recommended method to extinguish a fire.
Always aim the nozzle towards the base of fire.
The following are basic steps for the use of a fire extinguisher:
Remove fire extinguisher from the bracket and carry to
area of fire.
Approach area of fire with wind to your back.
Pull safety pin from top of extinguisher.
Hold extinguisher upright by handles and aim hose at the
Squeeze handles to discharge fire extinguisher.
Move nozzle back and forth, covering flames with a cloud
of powder.
At least once per month, inspect fire extinguishers and ensure
the following:
Are fire extinguishers positioned in designated location
on the cab ladder landing and at the rear of machine?
Are there any obstructions to proper access or visibility?
Are operating instructions on nameplate legible and facing
outward?
Are safety seals broken or missing?
Is extinguisher full? (Determines by weighing or “hefting”)
Is there any physical damage, corrosion, leakage, or a
clogged nozzle?
Are fire extinguisher bracket straps in good condition?
Are fire extinguisher bracket straps tight on the fire
extinguisher?
When inspection of the fire extinguisher reveals a deficiency,
extinguisher must be serviced or replaced.

# Fire Prevention
#### Charge Liquid Fire Extinguisher (If Required)
When an antifreeze charge is used to protect the extinguisher
from freezing, the extinguisher requires a complete discharge and
maintenance.
Fire extinguisher shown may vary depending
on country requirements and fire extinguisher manufacturers.
Before attempting to recharge, ensure that extinguisher
is completely depressurized.
Refer to information provided with the fire extinguisher
to properly fill and charge.
Install fire extinguisher
on the machine.

# Fire Prevention
#### Handle Fuel Safely—Avoid Fires
Handle fuel with care: it is highly flammable. Do not refuel
the machine while smoking or when near open flame or sparks.
Always stop engine before refueling machine. Fill fuel tank
outdoors.
Prevent fires by keeping machine clean of accumulated trash,
grease, and debris. Always clean up spilled fuel.
Use only an approved fuel container for transporting flammable
liquids.
Never fill fuel container in pickup truck with plastic bed liner.
Always place fuel container on ground before refueling. Touch fuel
container with fuel dispenser nozzle before removing can lid. Keep
fuel dispenser nozzle in contact with fuel container inlet when filling.
Do not store fuel container where there is an open flame, spark,
or pilot light such as within a water heater or other appliance.

# Fire Prevention
#### Prepare for Emergencies
Be prepared if a fire starts.
Keep a first aid kit and fire extinguisher handy.
Keep emergency numbers for doctors, ambulance service, hospital,
and fire department near your telephone.

# Fire Prevention
#### Handle Starting Fluid Safely
Starting fluid is highly flammable.
Keep all sparks and flame away when using it. Keep starting
fluid away from batteries and cables.
To prevent accidental discharge when storing the pressurized
can, keep the cap on the container, and store in a cool, protected
location.
Do not incinerate or puncture a starting fluid container.
Do not use starting fluid on an engine equipped with glow plugs
or an air intake heater.

# Fire Prevention
#### Remove Accumulated Crop Debris
The build up of chaff and crop debris in the engine compartment,
on the engine, and near moving parts is a fire hazard. Check and clean
these areas frequently. Before performing any inspection or service,
shut off the engine, set the parking brake and remove the key.

# Fire Prevention
#### Fire Extinguishers
A general-purpose powder fire extinguisher that is at
least 4 kg (8.8 lb)
A pressurized liquid fire extinguisher with minimum volume
of 8 L (2.1 gal)
Fire extinguishers shown may vary depending on country
requirements and fire extinguisher manufacturers.
A general-purpose powder fire extinguisher and a pressurized
liquid fire extinguisher with mounting brackets are installed on your
machine.
Read label on extinguishers and become familiar with instructions
on how to use and maintain them. Once extinguisher is discharged,
no matter for how long, it must be recharged or replaced.
Pressurized liquid fire extinguisher must not be
exposed to freezing temperatures unless protected with antifreeze.
See instruction decal on extinguisher for further information.

#### Fire Extinguisher Locations
A general-purpose powder fire extinguisher is behind the left-hand
front service door.
A pressurized liquid fire extinguisher is on the left-hand side
of the machine.

# Fire Prevention
#### In Case of Fire
Avoid personal injury.
Stop machine immediately at the first sign of fire. Fire may
be identified by the smell of smoke or sight of flames. Because fire
grows and spreads rapidly, get off the machine immediately and move
safely away from the fire. Do not return to the machine! The number
one priority is safety.
Call the fire department. A portable fire extinguisher can put
out a small fire or contain it until the fire department arrives;
but portable extinguishers have limitations. Always put the safety
of the operator and bystanders first. If attempting to extinguish
a fire, keep your back to the wind with an unobstructed escape path
so you can move away quickly if the fire cannot be extinguished.
Read the fire extinguisher instructions and become familiar
with their location, parts, and operation before a fire starts. Local
fire departments or fire equipment distributors may offer fire extinguisher
training and recommendations.
If your extinguisher does not have instructions, follow these
general guidelines:
Pull the pin. Hold the
extinguisher with the nozzle pointing away from you, and release the
locking mechanism.
Aim low. Point the extinguisher
at the base of the fire.
Squeeze the lever slowly
and evenly.
Sweep the nozzle from
side-to-side.

# Fire Prevention
#### Cleaning Engine Compartment


# Machine Cleanout
#### General Cleaning Guidelines
Machine must be inspected periodically throughout the harvest
day. Buildup of crop material and other debris must be removed to
ensure proper machine function and to reduce the risk of fire. Frequency
of inspections and cleanings vary depending on a number of factors,
including operating conditions, machine settings, crop conditions,
operating speeds, and weather conditions. Inspections and cleanings
may be required multiple times throughout the harvest day, particularly
in dry, hot, and windy conditions. Wet crop conditions can also pose
a fire risk under some circumstances.
Regular and thorough cleaning of machine combined
with other routine maintenance procedures listed in the Operator’s
Manual greatly reduce the risk of fire, chance of costly downtime,
and improve machine performance.
Crop material and other
debris can accumulate in various areas. Direction of wind, type of
crop, and crop moisture content can all impact where and how much
crop material and debris can accumulate. Be aware of harvest conditions
and adjust your cleaning schedule to ensure proper machine function
and to reduce the risk of fire. Inspect and clean these areas as needed
throughout the harvest day.
Harvesting certain crops can cause special issues. Some crops
are very “sticky” and it is often more difficult to clean the machine
when harvesting these crops. Examples of these crops include, but
are not limited to sunflower, canola, and safflower. Take special
care in cleaning the machine when harvesting these types of crops.
Always follow all safety procedures posted on the machine and
in the Operator’s Manual. Before carrying out any inspection or cleaning,
always shut OFF engine, set park brake, and remove key.

#### Cleaning Out Machine (Periodic Cleanout)
The photographs in this section show areas of the machine that
require regular inspection and cleaning. While there are other areas
that require regular cleaning, frequent attention to these areas provides
the greatest impact on fire prevention.
Some of these photographs show accumulations of crop material
and other debris prior to cleaning. This type of accumulation is not
normal; it was allowed for illustrative purposes only.
These areas may require more frequent cleaning, even
multiple times per day, depending on harvest conditions. Be aware
of harvest conditions and adjust your cleaning schedule to ensure
proper machine function and to reduce the risk of fire.
Other areas not covered in this section may also collect crop debris
and MUST be cleaned periodically for machine function and appearance.
Thoroughly inspect the entire machine on a regular basis throughout
the harvest season.
Before carrying out any inspection or cleaning, always shut
OFF engine, set park brake, and remove key.
Thoroughly clean machine from top to bottom with compressed
air. First, clean all areas accessible from the engine deck. Panels
or covers may need to be removed or opened to access areas for cleaning.
Start with engine compartment and work outwards and counterclockwise
to other areas around engine compartment, floor underneath engine,
top rear of rotor, and rear deck, including areas around exhaust aftertreatment
enclosure (if equipped). Once top areas of machine are clean, proceed
to cleaning areas accessible from the ground level.
From the ground level, clean rear underside of fuel tank area
and top of the rear tailboard of the residue disposal system. Once
the cleaning from the ground level is finished, recheck engine compartment
for any crop debris that could have blown in from the ground level

# Fuels and Lubricants
#### Handle Fuel Safely—Avoid Fires
Handle fuel with care: it is highly flammable. Do not refuel
the machine while smoking or when near open flame or sparks.
Always stop engine before refueling machine. Fill fuel tank
outdoors.
Prevent fires by keeping machine clean of accumulated trash,
grease, and debris. Always clean up spilled fuel.
Use only an approved fuel container for transporting flammable
liquids.
Never fill fuel container in pickup truck with plastic bed liner.
Always place fuel container on ground before refueling. Touch fuel
container with fuel dispenser nozzle before removing can lid. Keep
fuel dispenser nozzle in contact with fuel container inlet when filling.
Do not store fuel container where there is an open flame, spark,
or pilot light such as within a water heater or other appliance.

# Fuels and Lubricants
#### Avoid Static Electricity Risk When Refueling
The removal of sulfur and other compounds in Ultra-Low Sulfur
Diesel (ULSD) fuel decreases its conductivity and increases its ability
to store a static charge.
Refineries may have treated the fuel with a static dissipating
additive. However, there are many factors that can reduce the effectiveness
of the additive over time.
Static charges can build up in ULSD fuel while it is flowing
through fuel delivery systems. Static electricity discharge when combustible
vapors are present could result in a fire or explosion.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that the entire system
used to refuel your machine (fuel supply tank, transfer pump, transfer
hose, nozzle, and others) is properly grounded and bonded. Consult
with your fuel or fuel system supplier to ensure that the delivery
system is in compliance with fueling standards for proper grounding
and bonding practices.

# Fuels and Lubricants
#### Fuel Tank—Filling
Do not overfill fuel tank. Bodily injury can result
from fuel splash back. Leakage can result from expansion of fuel.
If fuel tank is too full and left in direct sunlight, or the temperature
is allowed to get too hot, fuel tank will overflow.
Final Tier 4/Stage V Engines: Use ONLY ultra low
sulfur diesel fuel. See Diesel Fuel and Biodiesel Fuel in this section
for further information.
Fill fuel tank (A) at end of each day. This prevents condensation
in the fuel tank as moist air cools.

# Fuels and Lubricants
#### Fast Fill Fuel System (If Equipped)
Remove the cap (A).
Remove the cap from the
nozzle.
Verify that the receiver and the nozzle are clean
and free of contaminants before connecting.
Clean the receiver (B).
The nozzle coupler locks when released. Verify that
the nozzle coupler is locked before fueling by pulling on the nozzle.
Attach nozzle coupler (B) to receiver (C).
Pull back on the handle (A) to release the nozzle
coupler (B) from the receiver (C).
Install the previously
removed cap on the receiver and nozzle coupler.

# Fuels and Lubricants
#### Handling and Storing Diesel Fuel
Reduce the risk of fire. Handle fuel carefully. DO
NOT fill the fuel tank when engine is running. DO NOT smoke while
you fill the fuel tank or service the fuel system.
Fill the fuel tank at the end of each day's operation to prevent
water condensation and freezing during cold weather.
Keep all storage tanks as full as practicable to minimize condensation.
Ensure that all fuel tank caps and covers are installed properly
to prevent moisture from entering. Monitor water content of the fuel
regularly.
When using BioDiesel fuel, the fuel filter may require more
frequent replacement due to premature plugging.
Check engine oil level daily prior to starting engine. A rising
oil level may indicate fuel dilution of the engine oil.
When fuel is stored for an extended period or if there is a
slow turnover of fuel, add a fuel conditioner to stabilize the fuel
and prevent water condensation. Contact your fuel supplier or John
Deere dealer for recommendations.

# Fuels and Lubricants
#### Diesel Fuel
Consult your local fuel distributor for properties of the diesel
fuel available in your area.
In general, diesel fuels are blended to satisfy the low temperature
requirements of the geographical area in which they are marketed.
Diesel fuels specified to EN 590 or ASTM D975 are recommended.
Renewable diesel fuel produced by hydrotreating animal fats and vegetable
oils is basically identical to petroleum diesel fuel. Renewable diesel
that meets EN 590, ASTM D975, or EN 15940 is acceptable for use at
all percentage mixture levels.
In all cases, the fuel shall meet the following properties:
DO NOT use E-Diesel (Diesel fuel and ethanol blend). Use of
E-Diesel fuel in any John Deere machine may void the machine warranty.
Avoid severe injury or death due to the fire and explosion
risk from using E-Diesel fuel.
Use ONLY diesel fuel with a maximum of 500 mg/kg (500
ppm) sulfur content.
Use ONLY ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel with a maximum
of 15 mg/kg (15 ppm) sulfur content.
Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content less than 1000
mg/kg (1000 ppm) is RECOMMENDED.
Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content 1000—2000 mg/kg
(1000—2000 ppm) REDUCES the oil and filter change interval.
BEFORE using diesel fuel with sulfur content greater than
2000 mg/kg (2000 ppm), contact your John Deere dealer.
Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content less than 2000
mg/kg (2000 ppm) is RECOMMENDED.
Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content 2000—5000 mg/kg
(2000—5000 ppm) REDUCES the oil and filter change interval.
BEFORE using diesel fuel with sulfur content greater than
5000 mg/kg (5000 ppm), contact your John Deere dealer.
Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content less than 5000
mg/kg (5000 ppm) is RECOMMENDED.
Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content greater than 5000
mg/kg (5000 ppm) REDUCES the oil and filter change interval.
Do not mix used diesel engine oil or any other type
of lubricating oil with diesel fuel.
Improper fuel additive
usage may cause damage on fuel injection equipment of diesel engines.

# Fuels and Lubricants
#### Biodiesel Fuel
Biodiesel fuel is comprised of monoalkyl esters of long chain
fatty acids derived from vegetable oils or animal fats. Biodiesel
blends are biodiesel mixed with petroleum diesel fuel on a volume
basis.
Before using fuel containing biodiesel, review the Biodiesel
Use Requirements and Recommendations in this Operator’s Manual.
Environmental laws and regulations can encourage or prohibit
the use of biofuels. Operators should consult with appropriate governmental
authorities prior to using biofuels.
Where the engine is to be operated within the Union on diesel
or non-road gas-oil, a fuel with a FAME content not greater than 8%
volume/volume (B8) shall be used.
Biodiesel blends up to B20 can be used ONLY if the biodiesel
(100% biodiesel or B100) meets ASTM D6751, EN 14214, or equivalent
specification. Expect a 2% reduction in power and a 3% reduction in
fuel economy when using B20.
Biodiesel concentrations above B20 can harm the engine’s emission
control systems and should not be used. Risks include, but are not
limited to, more frequent stationary regeneration, soot accumulation,
and increased intervals for ash removal.
John Deere Fuel conditioners or equivalent, which contain detergent
and dispersant additives, are required when using biodiesel blends
from B10 to B20, and are recommended when using lower biodiesel blends.
Biodiesel blends up to B20 can be used ONLY if the biodiesel
(100% biodiesel or B100) meets ASTM D6751, EN 14214, or equivalent
specification. Expect a 2% reduction in power and a 3% reduction in
fuel economy when using B20.
These John Deere engines can operate on biodiesel blends above
B20 (up to 100% biodiesel). Operate at levels above B20 ONLY if the
biodiesel is permitted by law and meets the EN 14214 specification
(primarily available in Europe). Engines operating on biodiesel blends
above B20 might not fully comply with or be permitted by all applicable
emissions regulations. Expect up to a 12% reduction in power and an
18% reduction in fuel economy when using 100% biodiesel.
John Deere fuel conditioners or equivalent, which contain detergent
and dispersant additives, are required when using biodiesel blends
from B10 to B100, and are recommended when using lower biodiesel blends.
The petroleum diesel portion of all biodiesel blends must meet
the requirements of ASTM D975 (US) or EN 590 (EU) commercial standard.
Biodiesel users in the U.S. are strongly encouraged to purchase
biodiesel blends from a BQ-9000 Certified Marketer and sourced from
a BQ-9000 Accredited Producer (as certified by the National biodiesel
Board). Certified Marketers and Accredited Producers can be found
at the following website:
Biodiesel contains residual ash. Ash levels exceeding the maximums
allowed in either ASTM D6751 or EN14214 can result in more rapid ash
loading and require more frequent cleaning of the Exhaust Filter (if
present).
The fuel filter can require more frequent replacement when using
biodiesel fuel, particularly if switching from diesel. Check engine
oil level daily prior to starting engine. A rising oil level can indicate
fuel dilution of the engine oil. Biodiesel blends up to B20 must be
used within 90 days of the date of biodiesel manufacture. Biodiesel
blends above B20 must be used within 45 days from the date of biodiesel
manufacture.
When using biodiesel blends up to B20, the following must be
considered:
Cold-weather flow degradation
Stability and storage issues (moisture absorption, microbial
growth)
Possible filter restriction and plugging (usually a problem
when first switching to biodiesel on used engines)
Possible fuel leakage through seals and hoses (primarily
an issue with older engines)
Possible reduction of service life of engine components
Request a certificate of analysis from your fuel distributor
to ensure that the fuel is compliant with the specifications provided
in this Operator’s Manual.
Consult your John Deere dealer for John Deere fuel products
to improve storage and performance with biodiesel fuels.
The following must also be considered if using biodiesel blends
above B20:
Possible coking or blocked injector nozzles, resulting
in power loss and engine misfire if John Deere fuel additives and
conditioners or equivalent containing detergent/dispersants are not
used
Possible crankcase oil dilution (requiring more frequent
oil changes)
Possible lacquering or seizure of internal components
Possible formation of sludge and sediments
Possible thermal oxidation of fuel at elevated temperatures
Possible compatibility issues with other materials (including
copper, lead, zinc, tin, brass, and bronze) used in fuel handling,
distribution, and storage equipment
Possible reduction in water separator efficiency
Possible damage to paint if exposed to biodiesel
Possible corrosion of fuel injection equipment
Possible elastomeric seal and gasket material degradation
(primarily an issue with older engines)
Possible high acid levels within fuel system
Because biodiesel blends above B20 contain more ash, using
blends above B20 can result in more rapid ash loading and require
more frequent cleaning of the Exhaust Filter (if present)
Raw pressed vegetable oils are NOT acceptable for
use as fuel in any concentration in John Deere engines. Their use
could cause engine failure.

# Fuels and Lubricants
#### Lubricity of Diesel Fuel
Most diesel fuels manufactured in the United States, Canada,
and the European Union have adequate lubricity to ensure proper operation
and durability of fuel injection system components. However, diesel
fuels manufactured in some areas of the world may lack the necessary
lubricity.
Make sure the diesel fuel used in your machine demonstrates
good lubricity characteristics.
Fuel lubricity should pass a maximum scar diameter of 0.52 mm
as measured by ASTM D6079 or ISO 12156-1. A maximum scar diameter
of 0.45 mm is preferred.
If fuel of low or unknown lubricity is used, add John Deere
Fuel-Protect Diesel Fuel Conditioner (or equivalent) at the specified
concentration.
Fuel lubricity can improve significantly with BioDiesel blends
up to B20 (20% BioDiesel). Further increase in lubricity is limited
for BioDiesel blends greater than B20.

# Fuels and Lubricants
#### Supplemental Diesel Fuel Additives
Diesel fuel can be the source of performance or other operational
problems for many reasons. Some causes include poor lubricity, contaminants,
low cetane number, and a variety of properties that cause fuel system
deposits. These and others are referenced in other sections of this
Operator's Manual.
To optimize engine performance and reliability, closely follow
recommendations on fuel quality, storage, and handling, which are
found elsewhere in this Operator's Manual.
To further aid in maintaining performance and reliability of
the engine's fuel system, John Deere has developed a family of fuel
additive products for most global markets. The primary products include
Fuel-Protect Diesel Fuel Conditioner (full feature conditioner in
winter and summer formulas) and Fuel-Protect Keep Clean (fuel injector
deposit removal and prevention). Availability of these and other products
varies by market. See your local John Deere dealer for availability
and additional information about fuel additives that might be right
for your needs.

# Fuels and Lubricants
#### Testing Diesel Fuel
A fuel analysis program can help to monitor the quality of diesel
fuel. The fuel analysis can provide critical data such as calculated
cetane index, fuel type, sulfur content, water content, appearance,
suitability for cold weather operations, bacteria, cloud point, acid
number, particulate contamination, and whether the fuel meets ASTM
D975 or equivalent specification.
Contact your John Deere dealer for more information on diesel
fuel analysis.

# Fuels and Lubricants
#### Minimizing the Effect of Cold Weather on Diesel Engines
John Deere diesel engines are designed to operate effectively
in cold weather.
However, for effective starting and cold-weather operation,
a little extra care is necessary. The following information outlines
steps that can minimize the effect that cold weather may have on starting
and operation of your engine. See your John Deere dealer for additional
information and local availability of cold-weather aids.
When temperatures fall below 0°C (32°F), winter grade fuel (No.
1-D in North America) is best suited for cold-weather operation. Winter
grade fuel has a lower cloud point and a lower pour point.
On average, winter grade diesel fuel has a lower Btu (heat
content) rating. Using winter grade fuel may reduce power and fuel
efficiency, but should not cause any other engine performance effects.
Check the grade of fuel being used before troubleshooting for low-power
complaints in cold-weather operation.
An air intake heater is an available option for some engines
to aid cold weather starting.
An ether port on the intake is available to aid cold weather
starting.
Ether is highly flammable. Do not use ether when starting
an engine equipped with glow plugs or an air intake heater.
An engine block heater (coolant heater) is an available option
to aid cold weather starting.
Use seasonal grade viscosity engine oil based on the expected
air temperature range between oil changes and a proper concentration
of low silicate antifreeze as recommended. (See DIESEL ENGINE OIL
and ENGINE COOLANT requirements in this section.)
Use John Deere Fuel-Protect Diesel Fuel Conditioner (winter
formula), which contains anti-gel chemistry, or equivalent fuel conditioner
to treat non-winter grade fuel (No. 2-D in North America) during the
cold-weather season. This generally extends operability to about 10°C
(18°F) below the fuel cloud point. For operability at even lower temperatures,
use winter grade fuel.
Treat fuel when outside temperature drops below 0°C
(32°F). For best results, use with untreated fuel. Follow all recommended
instructions on label.
When operating with biodiesel blends, wax formation can occur
at warmer temperatures. Begin using John Deere Fuel-Protect Diesel
Fuel Conditioner (winter formula) or equivalent at 5°C (41°F) to treat
biodiesel fuels during the cold-weather season. Use B5 or lower blends
at temperatures below 0°C (32°F). Use only winter grade petroleum
diesel fuel at temperatures below -10°C (14°F).
Use of fabric, cardboard, or solid winterfronts is not recommended
with any John Deere engine. Their use can result in excessive engine
coolant, oil, and charge air temperatures. This can lead to reduced
engine life, loss of power and poor fuel economy. Winterfronts may
also put abnormal stress on fan and fan drive components potentially
causing premature failures.
If winterfronts are used, they should never totally close off
the grill frontal area. Approximately 25% area in the center of the
grill should remain open at all times. At no time should the air blockage
device be applied directly to the radiator core.
If equipped with a thermostatically controlled radiator shutter
system, this system should be regulated in such a way that the shutters
are completely open by the time the coolant reaches 93°C (200°F) to
prevent excessive intake manifold temperatures. Manually controlled
systems are not recommended.
If air-to-air aftercooling is used, the shutters must be completely
open by the time the intake manifold air temperature reaches the maximum
allowable temperature out of the charge air cooler.
For more information, see your John Deere dealer.

#### Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) — Use in Selective Catalytic Reduction
(SCR) Equipped Engines
In order to maintain the emissions performance of the engine,
it is essential to use and refill DEF in accordance with the specification.
Diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) is a high purity liquid that is injected
into the exhaust system of engines equipped with selective catalytic
reduction (SCR) systems. Maintaining the purity of DEF is important
to avoid malfunctions in the SCR system. Engines requiring DEF shall
use a product that meets the requirements for aqueous urea solution
32 (AUS 32) according to ISO 22241-1.
The use of John Deere Diesel Exhaust Fluid is recommended. John Deere
Diesel Exhaust Fluid is available at your John Deere dealer in a variety
of package sizes to suit your operational needs.
If John Deere Diesel Exhaust Fluid is not available, use DEF
that is certified by the American Petroleum Institute (API) Diesel
Exhaust Fluid Certification Program or by the
In some cases, DEF is referred to by one or more of these names:

#### Testing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF)
Using DEF with the correct concentration is critical
to engine and aftertreatment system performance. Extended storage
and other conditions can adversely alter the DEF concentration.
If DEF quality is questionable, draw a sample out of the DEF
tank or storage tank into a clear container. DEF must be crystal clear
with a light ammonia smell. If DEF appears cloudy, has a colored tint,
or has a profound ammonia smell, it is likely not within specification.
DEF in this condition should not be used. Drain tank, flush with distilled
water and refill with new or good DEF. After refilling the tank, check
the DEF concentration.
If the DEF passes the visual and smell test, check the DEF concentration
with a handheld refractometer calibrated to measure DEF.
DEF concentration should be checked when the engine has been
stored for extended periods, or if there is suspicion the engine or
packaged DEF fluid has been contaminated with water.
Two approved tools are available through your John Deere dealer:
JDG11594 Digital DEF Refractometer—A digital tool providing
an easy to read concentration measurement
JDG11684 DEF Refractometer—Low-cost alternative tool providing
an analog reading
Follow instructions included with either tool to obtain the
measurement.
The correct DEF concentration is 31.8—33.2% urea. If the DEF
concentration is not within specification, drain the DEF tank, flush
with distilled water and fill with new or good DEF. If packaged DEF
is not within specification, dispose of DEF packages and replace with
new or good DEF.

# Fuels and Lubricants
#### Storing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF)
Avoid contact with eyes. In case of contact, immediately
flush eyes with large amounts of water for a minimum of 15 minutes.
Reference the Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for additional information.
Do not ingest DEF. In the event DEF is ingested, contact a physician
immediately. Reference the Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for
additional information.
It is unlawful to tamper with or remove any component
of the aftertreatment system. Do not use DEF that does not meet the
required specifications or operate the engine with no DEF.
Never attempt to create DEF by mixing agricultural grade urea with
water. Agricultural grade urea does not meet the necessary specifications
and can damage the aftertreatment system.
Do not add any
chemicals or additives to DEF in an effort to prevent freezing. Any
chemicals or additives added to DEF can damage the aftertreatment
system.
Never add water or any other fluid in place of,
or in addition to DEF. Operating with a modified DEF or using an unapproved
DEF can damage the aftertreatment system.
Storage information provided below is for reference and is to
be used as a guideline only.
It is preferred to store DEF out of extreme ambient temperatures.
DEF freezes at –11°C (12°F). Exposure to temperatures greater than
30°C (86°F) can degrade DEF over time. Do not store DEF in direct
sunlight.
Dedicated DEF storage containers must be sealed between uses
to prevent evaporation and contamination. Containers made of polyethylene,
polypropylene, or stainless steel are recommended to transport and
store DEF.
Ideal conditions for storage of DEF are:
Store at temperatures between –5°C and 30°C (23°F and
86°F)
Store in dedicated containers sealed to avoid contamination
and evaporation
Under these conditions, DEF is expected to remain useable for
a minimum of 18 months. Storing DEF at higher temperatures can reduce
its useful life by approximately 6 months for every 5°C (9°F) temperature
above 30°C (86°F).
If unsure how long or under what conditions DEF has been stored,
test DEF. See Testing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF).
Long-term storage in the DEF tank (over 12 months) is not recommended.
If long-term storage is necessary, test DEF prior to operating engine.
See Testing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF).
It is recommended to purchase DEF in quantities that will be
consumed within 12 months.

#### Refilling Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) Tank
Avoid contact with eyes. In case of contact, immediately
flush eyes with large amounts of water for a minimum of 15 minutes.
Reference the Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for additional information.
Do not ingest DEF. In the event DEF is ingested, contact a physician
immediately. Reference the Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for
additional information.
Use only distilled water to rinse components that
are used to deliver DEF. Tap water can contaminate DEF. If distilled
water is not available, rinse with clean tap water, then thoroughly
rinse with ample amounts of DEF.
If DEF is spilled or
contacts any surface other than the storage tank, immediately clean
the surface with clear water. DEF is corrosive to painted and unpainted
metallic surfaces and can distort some plastic and rubber components.
If DEF is filled into engine fuel tank or other fluid compartment,
do not operate engine until system is properly purged of DEF. Contact
your John Deere dealer immediately to determine how to clean and purge
the system.
Reasonable care should be taken when refilling the DEF tank.
Ensure that the DEF tank cap area is free of debris before removing
the cap. Seal containers of DEF between use to prevent contamination
and evaporation.
Avoid splashing DEF and do not allow DEF to come into contact
with skin, eyes, or mouth.
DEF is not harmful to handle, but DEF can be corrosive to materials
such as steel, iron, zinc, nickel, copper, aluminum, and magnesium.
Use suitable containers to transport and store DEF. Containers made
of polyethylene, polypropylene, or stainless steel are recommended.
Avoid prolonged contact with skin. In case of accidental contact,
wash skin immediately with soap and water.
Keep anything used to store or dispense DEF clean of dirt and
dust. Wash and rinse containers or funnels thoroughly with distilled
water to remove contaminants.
If an unapproved fluid, such as diesel fuel or coolant is added
to the DEF tank, contact your John Deere dealer immediately to determine
how to clean and purge the system.
If water has been added to the DEF tank, a tank cleaning is
necessary. See Cleaning DEF Tank in this manual. After refilling the
tank, check the DEF concentration. See Testing Diesel Exhaust Fluid
(DEF).
The operator must maintain appropriate DEF levels at all times.
Check the DEF level daily and refill the tank as needed. The filling
port is identified by a blue colored cap embossed with the following
DEF symbol.

# Fuels and Lubricants
#### Disposal of Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF)
Although there is little issue with minor spillage of DEF on
the ground, large amounts of DEF should be contained. If large spills
occur, contact local environmental authorities for assistance with
clean-up.
If a substantial quantity of DEF is not within specification,
contact the DEF supplier for assistance with disposal. Do not dump
substantial quantities of DEF onto the ground or send DEF to wastewater
treatment facilities.

#### Engine Oil and Filter Service Intervals — Tier 3 and Stage IIIA
— PowerTech™ Plus Engines
Recommended oil and filter service intervals are based on a
combination of oil pan capacity, type of engine oil and filter used,
and sulfur content of the diesel fuel. Actual service intervals also
depend on operation and maintenance practices.
“Plus-50 Oils” include John Deere
“Other Oils” include John Deere
Use oil analysis to evaluate the condition of the oil and to
aid in selection of the proper oil and filter service interval. Contact
your John Deere dealer or other qualified service provider for more
information on engine oil analysis.
Change the oil and oil filter at least once every 12 months
even if the hours of operation are fewer than the otherwise recommended
service interval.
Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content less than 1000
mg/kg (1000 ppm) is RECOMMENDED
Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content 1000—2000 mg/kg
(1000—2000 ppm) REDUCES the oil and filter change interval
BEFORE using diesel fuel with sulfur content greater than
2000 mg/kg (2000 ppm), contact your John Deere dealer or qualified
service provider

#### Engine Oil and Filter Service Intervals — Interim Tier 4, Final
Tier 4, Stage IIIB, Stage IV, and Stage V Engines
Failure to follow applicable oil standards and drain intervals
can result in severe engine damage that might not be covered under
warranty. Warranties, including the emissions warranty, are not conditioned
on the use of John Deere oils, parts, or service.
Recommended oil and filter service intervals are based on a
combination of oil pan capacity, type of engine oil and filter used,
and sulfur content of the diesel fuel. Actual service intervals also
depend on operation and maintenance practices.
John Deere
“Other Oils” include API CK-4, API CJ-4, ACEA E9, and
ACEA E6
Use oil analysis to evaluate the condition of the oil and to
aid in selection of the proper oil and filter service interval. Contact
your John Deere dealer or other qualified service provider for more
information on engine oil analysis.
Change the oil and oil filter at least once every 12 months
even if the hours of operation are fewer than the otherwise recommended
service interval.
Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content less than 15 mg/kg (15
ppm) is REQUIRED.
The 500 hour extended oil and filter change interval is
only allowed if all of the following conditions are met:
Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content less than 15 mg/kg
(15 ppm)
Use of John Deere Plus-50™ II oil
Use of an approved John Deere oil filter

# Fuels and Lubricants
#### Oil Filters
Filtration of oils is critically important for proper operation
and lubrication. John Deere brand oil filters have been designed and
produced specifically for John Deere applications.
John Deere filters adhere to engineering specifications for
quality of the filter media, filter efficiency rating, strength of
the bond between the filter media and the element end cap, fatigue
life of the canister (if applicable), and pressure capability of the
filter seal. Non-John Deere branded oil filters might not meet these
key John Deere specifications.
Always change oil filters regularly as specified in this manual.

# Fuels and Lubricants
#### Fuel Filters
The importance of fuel filtration cannot be overemphasized with
modern fuel systems. The combination of increasingly restrictive emission
regulations and more efficient engines requires fuel system to operate
at much higher pressures. Higher pressures can only be achieved using
fuel injection components with very close tolerances. These close
manufacturing tolerances have significantly reduced capacities for
debris and water.
John Deere brand fuel filters have been designed and produced
specifically for John Deere engines.
To protect the engine from debris and water, always change engine
fuel filters as specified in this manual.

# Fuels and Lubricants
#### Alternative and Synthetic Lubricants
Conditions in certain geographical areas may require lubricant
recommendations different from those printed in this manual.
Some John Deere brand coolants and lubricants may not be available
in your location.
Consult your John Deere dealer to obtain information and recommendations.
Synthetic lubricants may be used if they meet the performance
requirements as shown in this manual.
The temperature limits and service intervals shown in this manual
apply to John Deere branded fluids or fluids that have been tested
and/or approved for use in John Deere equipment.
Re-refined base stock products may be used if the finished lubricant
meets the performance requirements.

# Fuels and Lubricants
#### Lubricant Storage
Your equipment can operate at top efficiency only when clean
lubricants are used.
Use clean containers to handle all lubricants.
Store lubricants and containers in an area protected from dust,
moisture, and other contamination. Store containers on their side
to avoid water and dirt accumulation.
Make certain that all containers are properly marked to identify
their contents.
Properly dispose of all old containers and any residual lubricant
they may contain.

# Fuels and Lubricants
#### Mixing of Lubricants
In general, avoid mixing different brands or types of oil. Oil
manufacturers blend additives in their oils to meet certain specifications
and performance requirements.
Mixing different oils can interfere with the proper functioning
of these additives and degrade lubricant performance.
Consult your John Deere dealer to obtain specific information
and recommendations.

# Lubrication and Maintenance
#### Service Interval—Setup or Clearing
To prevent injury, never lubricate or service machine,
header, or engine while it is running. Shut OFF engine, set park brake
and remove key.
Service times are for average conditions. Service
more often if machine is used in extreme conditions.
See Calibrations Application Help or Operator's Station
Help for further information on setup or clearing service intervals.

# Lubrication and Maintenance
#### Lubrication Decal Locations
Bearing failures or overheating can result in a fire. To reduce
bearing failures or overheating, follow hour intervals listed in this
section for further information.
Crop material and other debris may accumulate around bearings
and bearing covers. Inspect and clean these areas periodically throughout
the harvest day.

# Lubrication and Maintenance
#### Working Underneath or Around Feeder House
See Feeder House Safety Lock in the Feeder House section for
further information.

# Lubrication and Maintenance
#### Hydraulic Hose Replacement
Hydraulic hoses should be inspected frequently for leakage,
kinking, cuts, cracks, abrasion, corrosion, exposed wire braid, or
any other signs of wear or damage. Worn or damaged hose assemblies
can fail during use and should be replaced immediately. See your John
Deere dealer for replacement hoses.
If incorrectly rated hose is used, machine damage,
injury or death could occur.
If hoses are to be fabricated, ensure that hoses are the same
rating as one being replaced. See your John Deere dealer for correct
hose rating replacements.
Incorrect hose length or routing can increase chance of hose
wear or damage. Use old hose as guide for length and hose routing.
Incorrect fittings can damage mating parts or cause leaks. Make
sure to use steel fittings approved for use with hose manufacture.
Use correct size and thread type as replaced hose.

# Lubrication and Maintenance
#### Hydraulic System Cleanliness
If an accident occurs,
see a doctor immediately. Any fluid injected into the skin must be
surgically removed within a few hours or gangrene can result. Doctors
unfamiliar with this type of injury may call the Deere & Company
Medical Department in Moline, Illinois, or other knowledgeable medical
source.
If hydraulic system should be disconnected for service, protect
ends of hoses, tubing, and ports of components from contamination
with clean, lint-free towels or clean plastic bags.
Before installing any replacement hose, flush the inside with
unused diesel fuel or unused commercial petroleum cleaning solvent
for 10 seconds minimum. Do not use water, water soluble cleaners,
or compressed air.
To prevent hydraulic system contamination, clean
the hydraulic component surfaces with an electrical contact cleaner.
Open the multicoupler covers (header and combine) and clean
the multicoupler surfaces of any dirt and debris.

# Lubrication and Maintenance
#### Accumulator Pressure
Due to temperature differences, accumulator pressures
can vary significantly and will need to be adjusted. See your John
Deere dealer for further information.

# Lubrication and Maintenance
#### Using High-Pressure Washers
Do not, under any circumstances,
spray, or wash components (example; engine) with cold water when hot.
Do not use rotary nozzles or water at temperatures over 50°C (122°F),
and do not aim at seals. Always keep the water jet moving. Reduce
pressure when using high-pressure washer to clean cooling units, bearings,
and electronic/electrical equipment. Directing pressurized water at
electronic/electrical components or connectors, bearings and hydraulics
seals, fuel injection pumps or other sensitive parts and components
may cause product malfunctions. Follow the instructions in the high-pressure
washer operator’s manual and manuals of attached equipment.

# Lubrication and Maintenance
#### Using Pressurized Air


# Lubrication and Maintenance
#### Lubrication Symbols
Never lubricate or service machine while the engine
is running.

# Maintenance—Every 500 Hours
#### Engine Oil and Filter
Change
the oil every 500 hours when using John Deere
Final Tier 4/Stage V engines require Plus-50™
II engine oil or API CK-4, API CJ-4, ACEA E9, ACEA E6 certified oils.
Use only ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel with a maximum
sulfur content of 15 mg/kg (15 ppm).
Remove and replace the oil filter (A).
To remove the oil, open
the drain valve (B).
To fill the oil, remove
the cap (C).

#### Change Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) Dosing Unit Filter
If DEF is spilled or contacts any surface other than
the storage tank, immediately clean the surface with clear water.
DEF is corrosive to painted and unpainted metallic surfaces and can
distort some plastic and rubber components.
Spilled DEF,
if left to dry or if only wiped away with a cloth, leaves a white
residue. Improperly cleaned DEF spill can interfere with diagnosis
of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system leakage problems.
The DEF dosing unit filter and DEF in-line filter must
be replaced together every 1500 hours or 36 months, whichever occurs
first.
Servicing DEF dosing unit filter requires removing
extra covers or components. See Access DEF Dosing Unit for location
information.

#### Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) Tank—Filling
Using incorrect or unapproved aftertreatment components
can damage the vehicle’s aftertreatment system and reduce ability
of the aftertreatment system to function correctly.
If DEF is spilled or contacts any surface other than the
storage tank, immediately clean the surface with clear water. DEF
is corrosive to painted and unpainted metallic surfaces and can distort
some plastic and rubber components.
Cap (A) is not vented. Excess air is vented through Diesel exhaust
fluid (DEF) tank breather (B).
Visually inspect the breather. Do not allow excessive amounts
of chaff or debris to collect on the breather. If the breather is
covered with debris, it does not allow the tank to breathe. Remove
the breather from the hose and clean.
Fill tank every time the machine is refueled. If this cannot
be done, monitor the Diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) level indicator on
the corner post display and refill as necessary. To avoid drastic
changes in the machine performance, always keep the fluid level above
the topmost red mark on the level indicator. See Combine Overview
Application Help or Operator’s Station for further information.
To fill tank:
Wash and rinse containers with distilled water to remove
contaminants before adding the fluid.
Wipe area around the cap before removing to reduce the
chance of contaminating fluid.
Using a funnel, carefully pour the fluid into the tank,
watching the level through the sight glass.
Install the previously removed cap.
Carefully clean any spills using distilled water.

# Maintenance—As Required (Engine Fluids and Filters)
#### Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) Tank—Draining
Long-term storage of fluids in the vehicle (over
12 months) is not recommended. If long-term storage is necessary,
periodic testing of the fluid is recommended to ensure that the urea

# Maintenance—As Required (Engine Fluids and Filters)
#### Diesel Particulate Filter Aftertreatment Replacement (Stage
V)
As the engine owner, you are responsible for performing the
required maintenance described in your Operator’s Manual. During normal
equipment operation, the DPF maintenance requirements will depend
on the rate at which ash accumulates in it. DPFs on engines above
175 hp/130 kW may require service or replacement at about 4500 hours.
As ash levels rise in the DPF, the capacity for soot storage is reduced
and the back pressure of the exhaust system will rise more frequently.
A diagnostic trouble code will appear, indicating when the DPF needs
servicing.
The removal of DPF ash must be done by removing the DPF from
the machine and placing it into specialized equipment. Do not remove
ash by using water or chemicals. Removing ash by these methods may
damage the material securing the DPF in its canister, resulting in
the loosening of the DPF element in the canister and subjecting it
to damage from vibration.
Failure to follow the approved ash removal methods may violate
U.S. federal, state, and local hazardous waste laws, and may also
damage the DPF, resulting in potential denial of the diesel exhaust
filter emissions warranty. It is strongly recommended you take the
DPF to an authorized John Deere service location or other qualified
service provider for service or replacement.
When AUTO or PARKED cleaning is enabled, the exhaust temperature
may be high under no load or light load conditions at certain times
during the exhaust filter cleaning cycle.
Disable exhaust filter cleaning system in conditions where it
may be unsafe for elevated exhaust temperatures.
Disable the automatic exhaust filter cleaning system only when
necessary.

# Maintenance—As Required (Engine Fluids and Filters)
#### Exhaust Filter / Diesel Particulate Filter Ash Handling and
Disposal (Stage V)
Under federal, state, and/or local laws or regulations,
diesel particulate filter (DPF) ash may be classified as a hazardous
waste. Hazardous waste must be disposed of in accordance with all
applicable federal, state, and local laws or regulations governing
hazardous waste disposal. Only a qualified service provider should
remove ash from the DPF.  Personal protective equipment and clothing,
maintained in a sanitary and reliable condition, should be used when
handling and cleaning a DPF. See your John Deere dealer or qualified
service provider for assistance.

# Maintenance—As Required (Engine Fluids and Filters)
#### Exhaust Filter Disposal (Stage V)
Proper management of an exhaust filter that has reached
the end of its useful life is required, since the ash or catalyst
material in the device may be classified as hazardous waste under
federal, state, and/or local laws or regulations. Used exhaust filter,
which includes the diesel particulate filter (DPF), may be exchanged
at any John Deere dealer or qualified service provider.

operation.
Clean the surfaces of the engine with a safe solvent.
Do not use gasoline for cleaning.
Clean inside the air cleaner and install new elements.
Drain the engine crankcase while the engine is warm. Replace
filter and fill with correct oil. Add 0.66 L (22 oz) of a corrosion
inhibitor to the engine crankcase. Run engine to circulate.
Drain, flush, and refill cooling system with 50/50 mixture of
antifreeze and water.
Long-term storage in vehicle (over 12 months) is
not recommended. If long-term storage is necessary, periodic testing
of diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) is recommended to ensure that urea concentration
does not fall out of specification.
Final Tier 4/Stage V: Do not disconnect battery for
at least 90 seconds after machine is shut OFF. Selective catalyst
reduction (SCR) system automatically purges lines of diesel exhaust
fluid (DEF) during this time, immediately after machine is shut OFF.
If adequate time is not allowed for lines to be purged, any fluid
remaining in lines can crystallize and plug lines. Fluid freezes and
possibly burst lines in freezing weather conditions.
Turn battery disconnect switch OFF if machine is stored
longer than 25 days. If storage period is longer than 90 days, remove
negative lead to batteries to minimize load to batteries.
Charge batteries completely. Specific gravity equals 1.260 volts.
To minimize load to the batteries, remove the negative lead to the
batteries.
Drain water separator.
Clean machine inside and out. Leave elevator doors and drain
covers open.
Cycle concave up and down several times to prevent material
buildup in the concave area.
Directing pressurized water at electronic/electrical
components or connectors, bearings and hydraulic seals, fuel injection
pumps, or other sensitive parts and components may cause product malfunctions.
Reduce pressure, and spray at a 45° to 90° angle.
Repaint areas where needed.
It is not necessary to wax the machine. However, if desired,
use a good clear wax that contains no abrasives. These types of waxes
usually do not contain cleaners.
Lubricate machine and grease adjusting bolt threads.
Perform all 400 hours (yearly) services.
To prevent condensation, fill fuel tank.
To stabilize the fuel and prevent water condensation,
add fuel conditioner when the following occurs:
Fuel is stored in the fuel tanks (machine or farm storage)
for extended periods of time. See your John Deere dealer for recommendations.
A slow turnover of fuel is being used. See your John Deere
dealer for recommendations.
For prolonged machine storage, the best practice is to drain
biodiesel and fill machine with regular petroleum diesel fuel. Otherwise,
use biodiesel stabilizer (anti-oxidant) additives or fully formulated
biodiesel conditioners. See your John Deere dealer for recommendations.
If machine is to be stored for a long period, remove and clean
the batteries. Store them in a cool, dry place and keep them fully
charged.
Before storing the machine, the air compressor reservoir (if
equipped) MUST be drained of water.
It is recommended to lower the feeder house roughly 50 mm (2
in) before shutting the machine off for long term storage or service.

# Storage
#### Removing Machine from Storage
Reconnect and/or charge batteries.
Charge batteries completely. Specific gravity equals 1.260 volts.
To minimize load to the batteries, remove negative lead to the batteries.
Check oil and coolant levels. Inspect for leaks and add oil
and coolant if needed.
Replace the
Close elevator doors and drain hole.
Check tension of drive belts. Adjust spring-loaded idlers until
the washer is positioned between the end of the gauge and the bottom
of the step.
Check tire inflation and review machine Operator's Manual.
Inspect fire extinguishers (front and left-hand side) by following
maintenance instructions on the fire extinguisher label. Recharge
or replace as necessary.

#### Emissions Control System Certification Label
Statutes providing severe penalties for tampering with
emissions controls may apply to the user or dealer.
The emissions warranty applies to those engines marketed by
John Deere that have been certified by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and/or California Air Resources Board (CARB);
and used in the United States and Canada in Non-road equipment. The
presence of an emissions label like the one shown signifies that the
engine has been certified with the EPA and/or CARB. The EPA and CARB
warranties only apply to new engines having the certification label
affixed to the engine and sold as stated above in the geographic areas.
The presence of an EU number signifies that the engine has been certified
with the European Union countries per Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 and
supplementing legislation. The EPA and/or CARB emissions warranties
do not apply to the EU countries.
The emissions label has applicable US EPA and/or CARB regulatory
year. The regulatory year determines which warranty statement is applicable
to engine. See “EPA Non-road Emissions Control Warranty Statement—Compression
Ignition” and “CARB Non-road Emissions Control Warranty Statement—Compression
Ignition”. For additional regulatory year warranty statements, see
www.JohnDeere.com or contact the nearest John Deere service dealer
for assistance.
The U.S. EPA and California ARB prohibit the removal or rendering
inoperative of any device or element of design installed on or in
engines/equipment in compliance with applicable emission regulations
prior to or after the sale and delivery of the engines/equipment to
the ultimate purchaser.
