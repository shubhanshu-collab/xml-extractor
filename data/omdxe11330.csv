Safety,Avoid Static Electricity Risk When Refueling,"The removal of sulfur and other compounds in Ultra-Low Sulfur
Diesel (ULSD) fuel decreases its conductivity and increases its ability
to store a static charge.
Refineries may have treated the fuel with a static dissipating
additive. However, there are many factors that can reduce the effectiveness
of the additive over time.
Static charges can build up in ULSD fuel while it is flowing
through fuel delivery systems. Static electricity discharge when combustible
vapors are present could result in a fire or explosion.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that the entire system
used to refuel your machine (fuel supply tank, transfer pump, transfer
hose, nozzle, and others) is properly grounded and bonded. Consult
with your fuel or fuel system supplier to ensure that the delivery
system is in compliance with fueling standards for proper grounding

Operating the Engine,Clean Exhaust Filter Safely,"During exhaust filter cleaning operations, the engine may run
at elevated idle and hot temperatures for an extended period of time.
Exhaust gases and exhaust filter components reach temperatures hot
enough to burn people, or ignite or melt common materials.
Keep machine away from people, animals, or structures which
may be susceptible to harm or damage from hot exhaust gases or components.
Avoid potential fire or explosion hazards from flammable materials
and vapors near the exhaust. Keep exhaust outlet away from people
and anything that can melt, burn, or explode.
Closely monitor machine and surrounding area for smoldering
debris during and after exhaust filter cleaning.
Adding fuel while an engine is running can create a fire or
explosion hazard. Always stop engine before refueling machine and
clean up any spilled fuel.
Always make sure that engine is stopped while hauling machine
on a truck or trailer.
Contact with exhaust components while still hot can result in
serious personal injury.
Avoid contact with these components until cooled to safe temperatures.
If service procedure requires engine to be running:
Only engage power-driven parts required by service procedure
Ensure that other people are clear of operator station
and machine
Keep hands, feet, and clothing away from power-driven parts.
Always disable movement (neutral), set the parking brake or

people, ignite, or melt common materials."
Operating the Engine,Aftertreatment Indicators Overview,"The operator will be informed by the operator warning
system when the emission control system does not function correctly
and/or an engine malfunction is detected by the engine control unit.
Ignoring the operator warning signals will lead to an emission related
derate, resulting in an effective disablement of non-road mobile machinery
operation.
It is essential to take prompt action to rectify any incorrect
operation, use or maintenance of the emissions control system in accordance
with the rectification measures indicated by the warnings referenced
below.
The Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) indicator illuminates when the
DEF is low. Fill DEF tank.
When the DEF indicator is combined with the warning indicator
or engine stop indicator engine performance is reduced by the Engine
Control Unit (ECU) because the DEF is below a measurable level. Fill
DEF tank.
When engine emissions temperature indicator illuminates exhaust
gas temperature is high, elevated idle is active, or exhaust filter
cleaning is in process. The machine can be operated as normal unless
the operator determines the machine is not in a safe location for
high exhaust temperatures and disables auto cleaning.
When engine emissions temperature indicator is combined with
the warning indicator or engine stop indicator engine performance
is reduced by the ECU because the exhaust gas temperature is higher
than expected. Follow Diagnostic Trouble Code (DTC) procedure or see
your authorized servicing dealer.
When the exhaust filter indicator illuminates the exhaust filter
cleaning is in process, aftertreatment system has a fault, or the
exhaust filter is in need of cleaning and the operator has disabled
auto exhaust filter cleaning. If conditions are safe, the operator
should enable the auto exhaust filter clean setting or perform manual
service regeneration or follow DTC procedure.
When the exhaust filter indicator is combined with the warning
indicator engine performance is reduced by the ECU because there is
an aftertreatment system fault or the soot level of the exhaust filter
is moderately high. If conditions are safe, the operator should enable
the auto exhaust filter clean function. If conditions are not safe,
the operator should move the machine to a safe location and engage
the auto exhaust filter cleaning mode. Perform manual service regeneration
or follow DTC procedure.
When the exhaust filter indicator is combined with the engine
stop indicator engine performance is further reduced by the ECU because
there is an aftertreatment system fault or the soot level of the exhaust
filter is extremely high. If this combination is present, see your
authorized servicing dealer.
The auto cleaning disabled indicator illuminates when the operator
has engaged the request to disable the auto exhaust filter cleaning
function. This icon remains illuminated until the operator re-engages
automatic exhaust filter cleaning from the diagnostic gauge. Disabling
auto mode is not recommended for any situation unless it is safety-related
or if the fuel tank lacks the required fuel to complete the cleaning
process.
The engine emissions system malfunction indicator illuminates
when engine emissions are outside of normal operating range or engine
emissions system fault. Follow DTC procedure or see your authorized
servicing dealer.
When the engine emissions system malfunction indicator is combined
with the warning indicator engine performance is reduced by the ECU

Engine Application,Parked Filter Cleaning,"Parked Filter Cleaning is a process which you initiate to clean
the exhaust filter when required.
During the process, engine speed is controlled by the system,
and the machine must remain parked to complete the procedure. Time
required for the Parked Filter Cleaning process is dependent upon
the level of exhaust filter restriction, ambient temperatures, and
current exhaust gas temperature.
When AUTO or PARKED cleaning is enabled, the exhaust
temperature can be high under no load or light load conditions at
certain times during the exhaust filter cleaning cycle.
Servicing machine or attachments during the exhaust filter cleaning
can result in serious personal injury. Avoid exposure and skin contact
with hot exhaust gases and components.
During auto or
manual/stationary exhaust filter cleaning operations, the engine runs
at elevated idle and hot temperatures for an extended period. Exhaust
gases and exhaust filter components reach temperatures hot enough
to burn people, or ignite, or melt common materials.
Damage to exhaust cleaning components can occur if
engine is turned OFF while performing exhaust filter cleaning or shortly
after cleaning is complete. Start machine and follow messages on display
to allow components to cool. See

Ground Drive and Rear Axle,Service Tires Safely,"Explosive separation of a tire and rim parts can cause
serious injury or death.
Do not attempt to mount a tire
unless you have the proper equipment and experience to perform the
job.
Always maintain the correct tire pressure. Do not inflate the
tires above the recommended pressure.
Never weld or heat a wheel and tire assembly. The heat can cause
an increase in air pressure resulting in a tire explosion. Welding
can structurally weaken or deform the wheel.
When inflating tires, use a clip-on chuck and extension hose
long enough to allow you to stand to one side and NOT in front of
or over the tire assembly. Use a safety cage if available.
Check wheels for low pressure, cuts, bubbles, damaged rims or
missing lug bolts and nuts."
Ground Drive and Rear Axle,Tire Loading Decal,
Ground Drive and Rear Axle,Care and Service of Tires,"Installing tires that do not meet original equipment
tire specifications may cause machine malfunction. Consult your dealer
or tire supplier for guidance.
Use of substandard tires
or larger than recommended tires will void warranty and may decrease
stability, affect steering, result in premature tire failure, or cause
other durability or safety issues.
Check tires daily for damage or noticeably low pressure.
At least every 100 hours of operation, check tire pressure.
If tires contain liquid ballast, use a special air-water gauge and
measure with valve stem at bottom.
A small puncture in a tubeless tire can be temporarily repaired
without dismounting the tire, thus avoiding down time during a busy
season.
Protect tires from exposure to sunlight, petroleum products,
and chemicals.
Drive carefully. Try to avoid rocks and sharp objects.
A permanent repair should be made as soon as possible
to prevent further tire damage.
Tire information and specifications are based on the latest
information available at the time of publication. The right is reserved
to make changes at any time without notice. See the online Combine
Ag Sales Manual or your John Deere dealer for further information
on Tire Pressure Charts.
Tire pressures listed in charts
may differ from the tire pressures shown on the side of the tires.
Header compatibility and specified inflation pressures are based
on front axle load of a coarse grain configuration.
Load
varies based on configuration. This may not reflect the worst case
scenario. Consult your local tire dealer if in doubt.
Not all tires are available on all machines or at all manufacturing
facilities.
Onboard Air Compressor (if equipped) - not
recommended to inflate tires on the machine or run air tools."
Ground Drive and Rear Axle,Basic Tire Information,"The diagonal tire (bias) is identified by conventional nomenclature.
The radial tire can be identified by conventional nomenclature
or international system.
The high flotation tires are identified by a mixed nomenclature."
Ground Drive and Rear Axle,Tire Tread Types,"There are three types of tread and these are the most used on
agricultural application."

A solution of water and calcium chloride provides a safe and
economical ballast. Used properly, it will not damage tires, tubes,
or rims.
Use calcium chloride to prevent water from freezing. A mixture
of 1.6 kg (3-1/2 lb) of calcium chloride per 3.8 L (1 gal) will not
freeze solid above -45°C (-50°F).
Use of alcohol as liquid ballast is not recommended. Calcium
chloride solution is heavier and more economical.
Fill tubeless tires at least to valve level (minimum 75% full).
Less solution would expose part of rim, possibly causing corrosion.

Harvesting Hints,Operation at Low Temperatures,"When operating in cold temperatures, verify that
proper grade diesel fuel is being used. Warmer grade diesel fuel will
gel in fuel lines, fuel filters, and fuel tank. Fuel system requires
servicing if diesel fuel gels. See Fuels and Lubricants section for
further information.
Combine functions can degrade in low temperatures where snow
and ice are present. Special care MUST be taken to ensure that minimal
snow is ingested in combine. If snow is ingested, areas such as chaffer,
cleaning fan, separator concaves, and separator grates can become
obstructed. Operation with these areas obstructed could cause machine
damage and significant repairs or result in functional performance
degradation. Consult your John Deere dealer prior to operating in
cold temperatures."
Harvesting Hints,Harvesting Tips,"Adjust machine to crop being harvested and to field conditions.
Select a ground speed that does not overload machine. Engine
must be at full rpm to keep separator at full speed. Select a ground
speed for slower travel, but do not slow engine speed.
If the concave is set too close for the harvested crop, straw
will be excessively ground up requiring more horsepower to thresh
the crop.
If the concave is set too wide for the harvested crop, it will
not be completely threshed.
After threshing clearance is adjusted properly, adjust separator
speed to achieve maximum threshing with the least amount of crop damage.
If crop damage does occur, reduce feed accelerator speed. Threshing
clearance in these crops has very little effect on seed damage.
Crops such as edible beans and peas are easily cracked and can
require the use of a slower feed accelerator drive. When harvesting
edible beans and peas keep machine full to provide enough material
to cushion the crop against cracking.
For potential improvements in straw quality consider that the
following can help improve straw quality depending on conditions:
Slowing feeder house chain speed
Slowing feed accelerator speed
Slowing rotor speed
Opening concave
Reducing threshing elements
Installing round bar concaves
For improved performance in sidehill conditions, consider trying
the following:
Adjust the position of the angled dividers on the front
step pan to improve shoe distribution.
Install tall chaffer dividers (available from your John
Deere dealer).
Install separator grate covers (if equipped) to improve
the chaff and grain distribution.
Each of these actions can improve the chaff and grain distribution
to the cleaning shoe, resulting in improved performance in sidehill
conditions.
When using a cutting platform, cut crop as high as possible
without loss of low heads. Adjust reel position and speed for even
feeding. Keep cutterbar in register and guards in alignment for clean
cutting.
When harvesting corn, keep corn head only as low as necessary
for ears. Keep it centered in the rows to prevent ear loss.
When using a belt pickup, keep windrow centered so material
is fed evenly into the feeder house. Grain heads must be lying in
one direction. Operate machine so heads are picked up first.
When harvesting soybeans with a row-crop head, keep header as
low as possible. When harvesting crops such as milo or sunflowers,
operate header just low enough to cut the heads from the stalks.
Adjust chaffer openings to pass grain or seed to the lower sieve
in the first two-thirds of the chaffer without admitting too much
coarse material.
Use as much air as possible without blowing over clean grain
and seed. Heavy crops require more air than light seed crops."

John Deere dealer for further information on changing the tire codes.
Failure to calibrate system results in inaccurate"
Harvesting Hints,Single Point Yield Calibration Or Multi-Point Yield Calibration,"The best way to keep the flow rate constant
is to monitor the
Single point yield calibration is performed when one or up to
three calibration loads are collected.
This type of calibration is suggested when the harvested field
has a fairly consistent yield and machine is operated at a constant
ground speed with little flow variation.
To collect a calibration load, harvest approximately 2722 kg
(6000 lb) at the maximum harvest speed.
Running one or two additional loads is not required, but it
may allow the system to average the overall error.
Multi-point yield calibration is used when the harvested field
is expected to have varying yields or machine is operated at varying
speeds with varying grain flows.
This type of calibration collects each calibration load at each
expected flow condition.
For each calibration load, harvest approximately 2722 kg (6000
lb).

Crop Settings,Power Shutdown Procedure,"A power shutdown is used to determine the machine’s performance
in the threshing and separating areas by taking a ""snapshot""
of the material in the separator. This is valuable in determining
where the losses behind the machine are generated and what adjustments
can be made to correct the condition.
Verify that crop
condition and material intake is similar for each shutdown.
Locate engine speed indicator on corner post display
and threshing speed readout on armrest display.
Lock brake pedals together.
Operate machine at optimized
throughput levels in the desired crop.
Move steering wheel forward
for free motion (both hands needed).
Press low idle engine
speed switch on armrest.
The machine is designed to have a slower draw down of
the engine rpm and more of a run-on for separator components.
Lightly depress brake pedals (machine attempts to
repower and downshifts changing the machine dynamics if brakes are
fully depressed).
Quickly move the multi-function
lever to neutral position.
Allow engine to cool
for a minute.
Inspect for excessive
grain damage, kernels left on the cobs, uneven distribution of material
on the return pan and cleaning shoe, and free grain loss before making
any adjustments.
Decide what adjustments
are needed. Open threshing clearance and engage separator (avoids
undue stress to cylinder drive area during cleanout).
Adjust machine to desired
settings and continue harvesting.
Repeat this procedure
and verify grain quality and losses behind machine.
Once acceptable loss
levels are attained, calibrate"

ensure proper machine function and to reduce the risk of fire. Frequency
of inspections and cleanings vary depending on a number of factors,
including operating conditions, machine settings, crop conditions,
operating speeds, and weather conditions. Inspections and cleanings
may be required multiple times throughout the harvest day, particularly
in dry, hot, and windy conditions. Wet crop conditions can also pose
a fire risk under some circumstances.
Regular and thorough cleaning of machine combined
with other routine maintenance procedures listed in the Operator’s
Manual greatly reduce the risk of fire, chance of costly downtime,
and improve machine performance.
Crop material and other
debris can accumulate in various areas. Direction of wind, type of
crop, and crop moisture content can all impact where and how much
crop material and debris can accumulate. Be aware of harvest conditions
and adjust your cleaning schedule to ensure proper machine function
and to reduce the risk of fire. Inspect and clean these areas as needed
throughout the harvest day.
Harvesting certain crops can cause special issues. Some crops
are very “sticky” and it is often more difficult to clean the machine
when harvesting these crops. Examples of these crops include, but
are not limited to sunflower, canola, and safflower. Take special
care in cleaning the machine when harvesting these types of crops.
Always follow all safety procedures posted on the machine and

Do not store fuel container where there is an open flame, spark,
or pilot light such as within a water heater or other appliance."
Fuels and Lubricants,Avoid Static Electricity Risk When Refueling,"The removal of sulfur and other compounds in Ultra-Low Sulfur
Diesel (ULSD) fuel decreases its conductivity and increases its ability
to store a static charge.
Refineries may have treated the fuel with a static dissipating
additive. However, there are many factors that can reduce the effectiveness
of the additive over time.
Static charges can build up in ULSD fuel while it is flowing
through fuel delivery systems. Static electricity discharge when combustible
vapors are present could result in a fire or explosion.
Therefore, it is important to ensure that the entire system
used to refuel your machine (fuel supply tank, transfer pump, transfer
hose, nozzle, and others) is properly grounded and bonded. Consult
with your fuel or fuel system supplier to ensure that the delivery
system is in compliance with fueling standards for proper grounding
and bonding practices."
Fuels and Lubricants,Fuel Tank—Filling,"Do not overfill fuel tank. Bodily injury can result
from fuel splash back. Leakage can result from expansion of fuel.
If fuel tank is too full and left in direct sunlight, or the temperature
is allowed to get too hot, fuel tank will overflow.
Final Tier 4/Stage V Engines: Use ONLY ultra low
sulfur diesel fuel. See Diesel Fuel and Biodiesel Fuel in this section
for further information.
Fill fuel tank (A) at end of each day. This prevents condensation
in the fuel tank as moist air cools."

Fuels and Lubricants,Handling and Storing Diesel Fuel,"Reduce the risk of fire. Handle fuel carefully. DO
NOT fill the fuel tank when engine is running. DO NOT smoke while
you fill the fuel tank or service the fuel system.
Fill the fuel tank at the end of each day's operation to prevent
water condensation and freezing during cold weather.
Keep all storage tanks as full as practicable to minimize condensation.
Ensure that all fuel tank caps and covers are installed properly
to prevent moisture from entering. Monitor water content of the fuel
regularly.
When using BioDiesel fuel, the fuel filter may require more
frequent replacement due to premature plugging.
Check engine oil level daily prior to starting engine. A rising
oil level may indicate fuel dilution of the engine oil.
When fuel is stored for an extended period or if there is a
slow turnover of fuel, add a fuel conditioner to stabilize the fuel
and prevent water condensation. Contact your fuel supplier or John
Deere dealer for recommendations."
Fuels and Lubricants,Diesel Fuel,"Consult your local fuel distributor for properties of the diesel
fuel available in your area.
In general, diesel fuels are blended to satisfy the low temperature
requirements of the geographical area in which they are marketed.
Diesel fuels specified to EN 590 or ASTM D975 are recommended.
Renewable diesel fuel produced by hydrotreating animal fats and vegetable
oils is basically identical to petroleum diesel fuel. Renewable diesel
that meets EN 590, ASTM D975, or EN 15940 is acceptable for use at
all percentage mixture levels.
In all cases, the fuel shall meet the following properties:
DO NOT use E-Diesel (Diesel fuel and ethanol blend). Use of
E-Diesel fuel in any John Deere machine may void the machine warranty.
Avoid severe injury or death due to the fire and explosion
risk from using E-Diesel fuel.
Use ONLY diesel fuel with a maximum of 500 mg/kg (500
ppm) sulfur content.
Use ONLY ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) fuel with a maximum
of 15 mg/kg (15 ppm) sulfur content.
Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content less than 1000
mg/kg (1000 ppm) is RECOMMENDED.
Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content 1000—2000 mg/kg
(1000—2000 ppm) REDUCES the oil and filter change interval.
BEFORE using diesel fuel with sulfur content greater than
2000 mg/kg (2000 ppm), contact your John Deere dealer.
Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content less than 2000
mg/kg (2000 ppm) is RECOMMENDED.
Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content 2000—5000 mg/kg
(2000—5000 ppm) REDUCES the oil and filter change interval.
BEFORE using diesel fuel with sulfur content greater than
5000 mg/kg (5000 ppm), contact your John Deere dealer.
Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content less than 5000
mg/kg (5000 ppm) is RECOMMENDED.
Use of diesel fuel with sulfur content greater than 5000
mg/kg (5000 ppm) REDUCES the oil and filter change interval.
Do not mix used diesel engine oil or any other type
of lubricating oil with diesel fuel.
Improper fuel additive
usage may cause damage on fuel injection equipment of diesel engines."
Fuels and Lubricants,Biodiesel Fuel,"Biodiesel fuel is comprised of monoalkyl esters of long chain
fatty acids derived from vegetable oils or animal fats. Biodiesel
blends are biodiesel mixed with petroleum diesel fuel on a volume
basis.
Before using fuel containing biodiesel, review the Biodiesel
Use Requirements and Recommendations in this Operator’s Manual.
Environmental laws and regulations can encourage or prohibit
the use of biofuels. Operators should consult with appropriate governmental
authorities prior to using biofuels.
Where the engine is to be operated within the Union on diesel
or non-road gas-oil, a fuel with a FAME content not greater than 8%
volume/volume (B8) shall be used.
Biodiesel blends up to B20 can be used ONLY if the biodiesel
(100% biodiesel or B100) meets ASTM D6751, EN 14214, or equivalent
specification. Expect a 2% reduction in power and a 3% reduction in
fuel economy when using B20.
Biodiesel concentrations above B20 can harm the engine’s emission
control systems and should not be used. Risks include, but are not
limited to, more frequent stationary regeneration, soot accumulation,
and increased intervals for ash removal.
John Deere Fuel conditioners or equivalent, which contain detergent
and dispersant additives, are required when using biodiesel blends
from B10 to B20, and are recommended when using lower biodiesel blends.
Biodiesel blends up to B20 can be used ONLY if the biodiesel
(100% biodiesel or B100) meets ASTM D6751, EN 14214, or equivalent
specification. Expect a 2% reduction in power and a 3% reduction in
fuel economy when using B20.
These John Deere engines can operate on biodiesel blends above
B20 (up to 100% biodiesel). Operate at levels above B20 ONLY if the
biodiesel is permitted by law and meets the EN 14214 specification
(primarily available in Europe). Engines operating on biodiesel blends
above B20 might not fully comply with or be permitted by all applicable
emissions regulations. Expect up to a 12% reduction in power and an
18% reduction in fuel economy when using 100% biodiesel.
John Deere fuel conditioners or equivalent, which contain detergent
and dispersant additives, are required when using biodiesel blends
from B10 to B100, and are recommended when using lower biodiesel blends.
The petroleum diesel portion of all biodiesel blends must meet
the requirements of ASTM D975 (US) or EN 590 (EU) commercial standard.
Biodiesel users in the U.S. are strongly encouraged to purchase
biodiesel blends from a BQ-9000 Certified Marketer and sourced from
a BQ-9000 Accredited Producer (as certified by the National biodiesel
Board). Certified Marketers and Accredited Producers can be found
at the following website:
Biodiesel contains residual ash. Ash levels exceeding the maximums
allowed in either ASTM D6751 or EN14214 can result in more rapid ash
loading and require more frequent cleaning of the Exhaust Filter (if
present).
The fuel filter can require more frequent replacement when using
biodiesel fuel, particularly if switching from diesel. Check engine
oil level daily prior to starting engine. A rising oil level can indicate
fuel dilution of the engine oil. Biodiesel blends up to B20 must be
used within 90 days of the date of biodiesel manufacture. Biodiesel
blends above B20 must be used within 45 days from the date of biodiesel
manufacture.
When using biodiesel blends up to B20, the following must be
considered:
Cold-weather flow degradation
Stability and storage issues (moisture absorption, microbial
growth)
Possible filter restriction and plugging (usually a problem
when first switching to biodiesel on used engines)
Possible fuel leakage through seals and hoses (primarily
an issue with older engines)
Possible reduction of service life of engine components
Request a certificate of analysis from your fuel distributor
to ensure that the fuel is compliant with the specifications provided
in this Operator’s Manual.
Consult your John Deere dealer for John Deere fuel products
to improve storage and performance with biodiesel fuels.
The following must also be considered if using biodiesel blends
above B20:
Possible coking or blocked injector nozzles, resulting
in power loss and engine misfire if John Deere fuel additives and
conditioners or equivalent containing detergent/dispersants are not
used
Possible crankcase oil dilution (requiring more frequent
oil changes)
Possible lacquering or seizure of internal components
Possible formation of sludge and sediments
Possible thermal oxidation of fuel at elevated temperatures
Possible compatibility issues with other materials (including
copper, lead, zinc, tin, brass, and bronze) used in fuel handling,
distribution, and storage equipment
Possible reduction in water separator efficiency
Possible damage to paint if exposed to biodiesel
Possible corrosion of fuel injection equipment
Possible elastomeric seal and gasket material degradation
(primarily an issue with older engines)
Possible high acid levels within fuel system
Because biodiesel blends above B20 contain more ash, using
blends above B20 can result in more rapid ash loading and require
more frequent cleaning of the Exhaust Filter (if present)
Raw pressed vegetable oils are NOT acceptable for
use as fuel in any concentration in John Deere engines. Their use
could cause engine failure."
Fuels and Lubricants,Lubricity of Diesel Fuel,"Most diesel fuels manufactured in the United States, Canada,
and the European Union have adequate lubricity to ensure proper operation
and durability of fuel injection system components. However, diesel
fuels manufactured in some areas of the world may lack the necessary
lubricity.
Make sure the diesel fuel used in your machine demonstrates
good lubricity characteristics.
Fuel lubricity should pass a maximum scar diameter of 0.52 mm
as measured by ASTM D6079 or ISO 12156-1. A maximum scar diameter
of 0.45 mm is preferred.
If fuel of low or unknown lubricity is used, add John Deere
Fuel-Protect Diesel Fuel Conditioner (or equivalent) at the specified
concentration.
Fuel lubricity can improve significantly with BioDiesel blends
up to B20 (20% BioDiesel). Further increase in lubricity is limited
for BioDiesel blends greater than B20."
Fuels and Lubricants,Supplemental Diesel Fuel Additives,"Diesel fuel can be the source of performance or other operational
problems for many reasons. Some causes include poor lubricity, contaminants,
low cetane number, and a variety of properties that cause fuel system
deposits. These and others are referenced in other sections of this
Operator's Manual.
To optimize engine performance and reliability, closely follow
recommendations on fuel quality, storage, and handling, which are
found elsewhere in this Operator's Manual.
To further aid in maintaining performance and reliability of
the engine's fuel system, John Deere has developed a family of fuel
additive products for most global markets. The primary products include
Fuel-Protect Diesel Fuel Conditioner (full feature conditioner in
winter and summer formulas) and Fuel-Protect Keep Clean (fuel injector
deposit removal and prevention). Availability of these and other products
varies by market. See your local John Deere dealer for availability
and additional information about fuel additives that might be right
for your needs."
Fuels and Lubricants,Testing Diesel Fuel,"A fuel analysis program can help to monitor the quality of diesel
fuel. The fuel analysis can provide critical data such as calculated
cetane index, fuel type, sulfur content, water content, appearance,
suitability for cold weather operations, bacteria, cloud point, acid
number, particulate contamination, and whether the fuel meets ASTM
D975 or equivalent specification.
Contact your John Deere dealer for more information on diesel
fuel analysis."
Fuels and Lubricants,Minimizing the Effect of Cold Weather on Diesel Engines,"John Deere diesel engines are designed to operate effectively
in cold weather.
However, for effective starting and cold-weather operation,
a little extra care is necessary. The following information outlines
steps that can minimize the effect that cold weather may have on starting
and operation of your engine. See your John Deere dealer for additional
information and local availability of cold-weather aids.
When temperatures fall below 0°C (32°F), winter grade fuel (No.
1-D in North America) is best suited for cold-weather operation. Winter
grade fuel has a lower cloud point and a lower pour point.
On average, winter grade diesel fuel has a lower Btu (heat
content) rating. Using winter grade fuel may reduce power and fuel
efficiency, but should not cause any other engine performance effects.
Check the grade of fuel being used before troubleshooting for low-power
complaints in cold-weather operation.
An air intake heater is an available option for some engines
to aid cold weather starting.
An ether port on the intake is available to aid cold weather
starting.
Ether is highly flammable. Do not use ether when starting
an engine equipped with glow plugs or an air intake heater.
An engine block heater (coolant heater) is an available option
to aid cold weather starting.
Use seasonal grade viscosity engine oil based on the expected
air temperature range between oil changes and a proper concentration
of low silicate antifreeze as recommended. (See DIESEL ENGINE OIL
and ENGINE COOLANT requirements in this section.)
Use John Deere Fuel-Protect Diesel Fuel Conditioner (winter
formula), which contains anti-gel chemistry, or equivalent fuel conditioner
to treat non-winter grade fuel (No. 2-D in North America) during the
cold-weather season. This generally extends operability to about 10°C
(18°F) below the fuel cloud point. For operability at even lower temperatures,
use winter grade fuel.
Treat fuel when outside temperature drops below 0°C
(32°F). For best results, use with untreated fuel. Follow all recommended
instructions on label.
When operating with biodiesel blends, wax formation can occur
at warmer temperatures. Begin using John Deere Fuel-Protect Diesel
Fuel Conditioner (winter formula) or equivalent at 5°C (41°F) to treat
biodiesel fuels during the cold-weather season. Use B5 or lower blends
at temperatures below 0°C (32°F). Use only winter grade petroleum
diesel fuel at temperatures below -10°C (14°F).
Use of fabric, cardboard, or solid winterfronts is not recommended
with any John Deere engine. Their use can result in excessive engine
coolant, oil, and charge air temperatures. This can lead to reduced
engine life, loss of power and poor fuel economy. Winterfronts may
also put abnormal stress on fan and fan drive components potentially
causing premature failures.
If winterfronts are used, they should never totally close off
the grill frontal area. Approximately 25% area in the center of the
grill should remain open at all times. At no time should the air blockage
device be applied directly to the radiator core.
If equipped with a thermostatically controlled radiator shutter
system, this system should be regulated in such a way that the shutters
are completely open by the time the coolant reaches 93°C (200°F) to
prevent excessive intake manifold temperatures. Manually controlled
systems are not recommended.
If air-to-air aftercooling is used, the shutters must be completely
open by the time the intake manifold air temperature reaches the maximum
allowable temperature out of the charge air cooler.

Fuels and Lubricants,"Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) — Use in Selective Catalytic Reduction
(SCR) Equipped Engines","In order to maintain the emissions performance of the engine,
it is essential to use and refill DEF in accordance with the specification.
Diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) is a high purity liquid that is injected
into the exhaust system of engines equipped with selective catalytic
reduction (SCR) systems. Maintaining the purity of DEF is important
to avoid malfunctions in the SCR system. Engines requiring DEF shall
use a product that meets the requirements for aqueous urea solution
32 (AUS 32) according to ISO 22241-1.
The use of John Deere Diesel Exhaust Fluid is recommended. John Deere
Diesel Exhaust Fluid is available at your John Deere dealer in a variety
of package sizes to suit your operational needs.
If John Deere Diesel Exhaust Fluid is not available, use DEF
that is certified by the American Petroleum Institute (API) Diesel
Exhaust Fluid Certification Program or by the
In some cases, DEF is referred to by one or more of these names:

Fuels and Lubricants,Testing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF),"Using DEF with the correct concentration is critical
to engine and aftertreatment system performance. Extended storage
and other conditions can adversely alter the DEF concentration.
If DEF quality is questionable, draw a sample out of the DEF
tank or storage tank into a clear container. DEF must be crystal clear
with a light ammonia smell. If DEF appears cloudy, has a colored tint,
or has a profound ammonia smell, it is likely not within specification.
DEF in this condition should not be used. Drain tank, flush with distilled
water and refill with new or good DEF. After refilling the tank, check
the DEF concentration.
If the DEF passes the visual and smell test, check the DEF concentration
with a handheld refractometer calibrated to measure DEF.
DEF concentration should be checked when the engine has been
stored for extended periods, or if there is suspicion the engine or
packaged DEF fluid has been contaminated with water.
Two approved tools are available through your John Deere dealer:
JDG11594 Digital DEF Refractometer—A digital tool providing
an easy to read concentration measurement
JDG11684 DEF Refractometer—Low-cost alternative tool providing
an analog reading
Follow instructions included with either tool to obtain the
measurement.
The correct DEF concentration is 31.8—33.2% urea. If the DEF
concentration is not within specification, drain the DEF tank, flush
with distilled water and fill with new or good DEF. If packaged DEF
is not within specification, dispose of DEF packages and replace with
new or good DEF."
Fuels and Lubricants,Storing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF),"Avoid contact with eyes. In case of contact, immediately
flush eyes with large amounts of water for a minimum of 15 minutes.
Reference the Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for additional information.
Do not ingest DEF. In the event DEF is ingested, contact a physician
immediately. Reference the Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for
additional information.
It is unlawful to tamper with or remove any component
of the aftertreatment system. Do not use DEF that does not meet the
required specifications or operate the engine with no DEF.
Never attempt to create DEF by mixing agricultural grade urea with
water. Agricultural grade urea does not meet the necessary specifications
and can damage the aftertreatment system.
Do not add any
chemicals or additives to DEF in an effort to prevent freezing. Any
chemicals or additives added to DEF can damage the aftertreatment
system.
Never add water or any other fluid in place of,
or in addition to DEF. Operating with a modified DEF or using an unapproved
DEF can damage the aftertreatment system.
Storage information provided below is for reference and is to
be used as a guideline only.
It is preferred to store DEF out of extreme ambient temperatures.
DEF freezes at –11°C (12°F). Exposure to temperatures greater than
30°C (86°F) can degrade DEF over time. Do not store DEF in direct
sunlight.
Dedicated DEF storage containers must be sealed between uses
to prevent evaporation and contamination. Containers made of polyethylene,
polypropylene, or stainless steel are recommended to transport and
store DEF.
Ideal conditions for storage of DEF are:
Store at temperatures between –5°C and 30°C (23°F and
86°F)
Store in dedicated containers sealed to avoid contamination
and evaporation
Under these conditions, DEF is expected to remain useable for
a minimum of 18 months. Storing DEF at higher temperatures can reduce
its useful life by approximately 6 months for every 5°C (9°F) temperature
above 30°C (86°F).
If unsure how long or under what conditions DEF has been stored,
test DEF. See Testing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF).
Long-term storage in the DEF tank (over 12 months) is not recommended.
If long-term storage is necessary, test DEF prior to operating engine.
See Testing Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF).
It is recommended to purchase DEF in quantities that will be
consumed within 12 months."
Fuels and Lubricants,Refilling Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) Tank,"Avoid contact with eyes. In case of contact, immediately
flush eyes with large amounts of water for a minimum of 15 minutes.
Reference the Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for additional information.
Do not ingest DEF. In the event DEF is ingested, contact a physician
immediately. Reference the Materials Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for
additional information.
Use only distilled water to rinse components that
are used to deliver DEF. Tap water can contaminate DEF. If distilled
water is not available, rinse with clean tap water, then thoroughly
rinse with ample amounts of DEF.
If DEF is spilled or
contacts any surface other than the storage tank, immediately clean
the surface with clear water. DEF is corrosive to painted and unpainted
metallic surfaces and can distort some plastic and rubber components.
If DEF is filled into engine fuel tank or other fluid compartment,
do not operate engine until system is properly purged of DEF. Contact
your John Deere dealer immediately to determine how to clean and purge
the system.
Reasonable care should be taken when refilling the DEF tank.
Ensure that the DEF tank cap area is free of debris before removing
the cap. Seal containers of DEF between use to prevent contamination
and evaporation.
Avoid splashing DEF and do not allow DEF to come into contact
with skin, eyes, or mouth.
DEF is not harmful to handle, but DEF can be corrosive to materials
such as steel, iron, zinc, nickel, copper, aluminum, and magnesium.
Use suitable containers to transport and store DEF. Containers made
of polyethylene, polypropylene, or stainless steel are recommended.
Avoid prolonged contact with skin. In case of accidental contact,
wash skin immediately with soap and water.
Keep anything used to store or dispense DEF clean of dirt and
dust. Wash and rinse containers or funnels thoroughly with distilled
water to remove contaminants.
If an unapproved fluid, such as diesel fuel or coolant is added
to the DEF tank, contact your John Deere dealer immediately to determine
how to clean and purge the system.
If water has been added to the DEF tank, a tank cleaning is
necessary. See Cleaning DEF Tank in this manual. After refilling the

equipment operation, the DPF maintenance requirements will depend
on the rate at which ash accumulates in it. DPFs on engines above
175 hp/130 kW may require service or replacement at about 4500 hours.
As ash levels rise in the DPF, the capacity for soot storage is reduced
and the back pressure of the exhaust system will rise more frequently.

operation.
Clean the surfaces of the engine with a safe solvent.
Do not use gasoline for cleaning.
Clean inside the air cleaner and install new elements.
Drain the engine crankcase while the engine is warm. Replace
filter and fill with correct oil. Add 0.66 L (22 oz) of a corrosion
inhibitor to the engine crankcase. Run engine to circulate.
Drain, flush, and refill cooling system with 50/50 mixture of
antifreeze and water.
Long-term storage in vehicle (over 12 months) is
not recommended. If long-term storage is necessary, periodic testing
of diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) is recommended to ensure that urea concentration
does not fall out of specification.
Final Tier 4/Stage V: Do not disconnect battery for
at least 90 seconds after machine is shut OFF. Selective catalyst
reduction (SCR) system automatically purges lines of diesel exhaust
fluid (DEF) during this time, immediately after machine is shut OFF.
If adequate time is not allowed for lines to be purged, any fluid
remaining in lines can crystallize and plug lines. Fluid freezes and
possibly burst lines in freezing weather conditions.
Turn battery disconnect switch OFF if machine is stored
longer than 25 days. If storage period is longer than 90 days, remove
negative lead to batteries to minimize load to batteries.
Charge batteries completely. Specific gravity equals 1.260 volts.
To minimize load to the batteries, remove the negative lead to the
batteries.
Drain water separator.
Clean machine inside and out. Leave elevator doors and drain
covers open.
Cycle concave up and down several times to prevent material
buildup in the concave area.
Directing pressurized water at electronic/electrical
components or connectors, bearings and hydraulic seals, fuel injection
pumps, or other sensitive parts and components may cause product malfunctions.
Reduce pressure, and spray at a 45° to 90° angle.
Repaint areas where needed.
It is not necessary to wax the machine. However, if desired,
use a good clear wax that contains no abrasives. These types of waxes
usually do not contain cleaners.
Lubricate machine and grease adjusting bolt threads.
Perform all 400 hours (yearly) services.
To prevent condensation, fill fuel tank.
To stabilize the fuel and prevent water condensation,
add fuel conditioner when the following occurs:
Fuel is stored in the fuel tanks (machine or farm storage)
for extended periods of time. See your John Deere dealer for recommendations.
A slow turnover of fuel is being used. See your John Deere
dealer for recommendations.
For prolonged machine storage, the best practice is to drain
biodiesel and fill machine with regular petroleum diesel fuel. Otherwise,
use biodiesel stabilizer (anti-oxidant) additives or fully formulated
biodiesel conditioners. See your John Deere dealer for recommendations.
If machine is to be stored for a long period, remove and clean
the batteries. Store them in a cool, dry place and keep them fully
charged.
Before storing the machine, the air compressor reservoir (if
equipped) MUST be drained of water.
It is recommended to lower the feeder house roughly 50 mm (2
in) before shutting the machine off for long term storage or service."
Storage,Removing Machine from Storage,"Reconnect and/or charge batteries.
